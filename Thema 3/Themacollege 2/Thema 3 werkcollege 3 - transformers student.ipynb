    "We gaan hier door met de 'videogames review' dataset van vorige week. Vorige keer zagen we dat we met diverse Recurrent Neural Netwerken eigenlijk steeds niet hoger kwamen dan een validated accuracy van net onder de 91%. Transformers bieden een alternatieve en modernere aanpak, welke we hier verder gaan verkennen. \n",

    "Om te beginnen lezen we hier de dataset weer in; tokenizen we deze; voegen we padding toe. Aangezien we deze stappen nu wel begrijpen doen we het nu met behulp van een <u>vectorization layer</u>. Dit vraagt wel wat voorbereiding aangezien we hiervoor onze train en test dataframes om moeten zetten naar een dataset object. Dit heeft onder andere als voordeel dat we niet alles in 1 keer in het geheugen hoeven te laden. Nu is dit hier nog niet zo van belang, maar bij grotere datasets wel. \n",

      "[b'It\\'s perhaps worthwhile getting this if you buy it packaged with the remote.  But without the remote, it\\'s not worth the $10.  Most of the minigames aren\\'t all that fun, with the \"Duck Hunt\" game being the best, in my opinion, but that\\'s too short to really be enjoyable for much more than a couple of plays.  We had significant trouble getting the fishing and billiards games to work (perhaps where we have the sensor makes it difficult to register, but it\\'s worked very well for other games, like the shooter, so who knows?).  I\\'m not losing any sleep over the extra $10 I paid to get the game, but you really won\\'t get much play time out of it at all, and I agree with some other reviews I\\'ve seen that say it\\'s not worth the extra $10 - just buy the remote on its own.'\n",

      " b\"Well I just beat two computer players on the hard setting for the first time.  Of course, it took 7 1/2 hours and about 10 nuke bombers.\\nBought the game 2 months ago for $29 + tax at Wal-Mart.  Amazon is a better buy.\\nAbout the game:\\n1) great graphics and sound.  I run a 2.53 GHZ Dell with 64 meg video NVIDIA card and 256 meg ram.  Game runs great.\\n2) Awesome gameplay.  I tired of beating the comp on Age of Empires Conqueors so I bought this and am not sorry.  As noted in 1, the graphics are much better than AOE II.  However, the graphics are similar to Age of Mythology.\\n3) Lots of weapons to choose from.  Keep the production up and you will win.\\n4) Hope this review helped.  Can't wait to get home and play the Expansion pack today.\"\n",
      " b\"The Rock Band wireless guitar has the look of a real Fender Strat and is noticeably bigger than any Guitar Hero controller.  It definitely feels less like a toy than its competition.  However, performance is ultimately what matters and in this realm, it falls short.\\n\\nBoth the strum bar and the fret buttons feel radically different from the GH controller.  After using both for a while, the GH controller lends itself to better accuracy and higher scores.  The strum bar on the RB guitar is free-floating, i.e. there is no clicking into place with each strum.  I find that the clicking provides your strum hand with necessary feedback on when a note has been registered.  You'll miss a few here and there on the RB guitar as a result.  But the real crime is the fret buttons.  They're nicely-sized, covering the entire fret, so I expected the RB guitar to shine here.  However, they actually do click (and click hard) into and out of place with each press.  Plus, the plastic is strangely sticky compared to the much slicker buttons on the GH controller.  All of this combines into more difficult gameplay, which makes the RB controller less useful and fun to play.\\n\\nThe RB guitar adds some bells-and-whistles functionality like an effects switch and high fret buttons, but they're just unnecessary gimmicks.  Each of the effects just make your playing sound bizarre because their depth is way too deep.  The high fret buttons can be used to solo with one hand (i.e. no strumming necessary), but it's more of a hassle than it initially sounds.  The buttons are awkward to reach, it's difficult to move from the lower to the higher button sets on faster songs that transition quickly to/from the solos, and ultimately, it diminishes the feel and fun of actually playing guitar.\\n\\nMuch like the drum kit for Rock Band, this peripheral needed a little more time on the design table.  Rock Band may be the superior game, but the instrument controllers just aren't up to par.\\n\\nPROS\\n\\n*  Unibody construction has a good, solid feel compared to the detachable neck of the GH guitar\\n*  Large, full-fret buttons\\n\\nCONS\\n\\n*  Sticky/clicky buttons coupled with floating strumbar greatly diminish gameplay performance\\n*  Control configuration is tough for lefties to use\\n*  Incompatible with Guitar Hero games\"\n",
      " b'I truly enjoyed this game, and almost feel jipped since it took so long for them to port this game to a system I have from the dreamcast.\\nThe storyline is perfect, classic resident evil.  The age old tale of good versus the evil (and slightly demented).  Each character you meet has his own story, but it\\'s not randomly thrown in there.  I can\\'t even explain it on paper without ruining the experience for you, so I\\'ll just say that the story is marvelous.\\nThe game play is even better than previous RE\\'s, with weapons from the old series and a few surprises.  I love the fact that there are weaons that come in pairs, so you can aim at two different enemies at once.  The levels are interesting to play, and I never feel \"ahh, I have to go all the way around there again?  I\\'m bored, why is this so long?!\"\\nSpeaking of length, this RE is also the longest I\\'ve played so far.  The game takes is time slowing bringing you into the world of survival horror.\\nThe music is great, again.  There\\'s a recurring theme in the story, and each time it is played it reminds you of previous scenes in the game... like a ritornello in a concerto, bringing you back into familar terrority.  I like what that does with the mood.\\nThe opening move sequence immediatly brings you into the game.  And later scenes have equal quality sequences.  The facial expressions in the CG\\'s have improved immensely, as well as the character\\'s body position as they interact (no more \"I feel like chicken tonight\" elbows while Clare talks to Leon ^_^)\\nThe only real thing I have to complain about is the terrible voice acting, but that goes with the RE territory, so I\\'d almost miss it if it wasn\\'t there (it wouldn\\'t be a B-movie like game otherwise!  It\\'s almost classic now.)'\n",
      " b'WHY play this when you cannot read the  code! If you need a new doorstop, buy this game! Aggravation is paramount to TRYING to play this!'\n",
      " b'After all the hype people gave this game I was expecting the revolution of MMORPG games from it. I suppose that my expectations could be considered to high. This game is nothing more than an upgraded version of Lineage 2 meets World of warcraft. You have a WoW style quest system in a Lineage 2 style world and lore. Open world PvP which is not optional as well as a very steep grind. If you are the type who enjoys to quest for 10-12 hours to gain a single level then maybe you will be able to reach the level cap in this game. From my personal experience Aion has a much steeper grind than WoW so if you are looking for something more casual, or an upgrade to WoW I would say try other games first. This can be a fun game but only if you are willing to put in the huge massive amounts of time it will take you to level up your character.\\n\\nAlong with the terrible grind you also have a broken security system. In the 2 months that I played this game 3 people in my Legion were hacked and their accounts suspended. They did absolutely nothing wrong in fact I knew one person from another game who came with me to try this one. Ncsoft does a terrible job at keeping the game secure and your account can be compromised at any time. If you really want to try this game I would say wait until at least the end of 2010 if the game is still alive by then it should be more polished, refined, and the security issues should be a thing of the past.'\n",
      " b\"I've had my eye on ESIII: Morrowind for some time since the XBOX initially launched.  I held off on buying it when it was released due to the lack of time necessary to invest in this mega huge game.  Now that it's been re-released as a Platinum Hit it made no sense to hold off buying it.\\nThe game is absolutely HUGE.  This is the kind of adventure/RPG game we old school gamers wished for back in the Atari/NES days.  The level of detail is staggering.  There are so many caves/shrines/special locations, all rendered with the utmost detail, one can only wonder how long it took the developers to put this game together!  Some locations are never even used in the main quest!  The bulk of the enjoyment comes from the various side quests and faction quests you can take part in that hvae nothing to do with the Main Quest.  You can join a guild, carry out tasks, or just roam around the varied countryside.  The open endedness is refreshing--for once you can do whatever you want whenever you want!  Should you scope out the hidden mine or help out a townsperson find their stolen jewels?  The choices are yours and the choices are often numerous!\\nI absolutely love this game!  The variety in the graphics, landscapes are breathtaking.  Developing your character is such a joy in this game as the experience system is vastly different from other RPG's!  The weapons and magic system is deep.  And you can even enchant your items!  This game has it all.  It's like an alternate life that you can live and no other game has potrayed it this well.  And those stability issues that others complain about?  Don't beleive them.  I have yet to encounter a crash or glitch in the 30 hours I've invested in the game so far.\"\n",
      " b\"The real reason to own a PS3 is this game right here. Konami has done it again with MGS4 being the GOTY contender in my book plus the greatest game of all time. I had doubts about MGS4 mainly because Snake has age alot since MGS2 and time has passed by since the events of MGS2. Old characters return from MGS1,MGS2, and MGS3 bringing the events of what happened in the previous games together in this awesome game. You also get new characters who are introduced in MGS4 that feel as they should of been in the previous games included. The graphics push the PS3 to the max almost and the voice acting is amazing plus the controls have gotten a makeover from the previous games. The online mode is better than MGS3 and old maps and new ones return. You should really check out MGS4 if you are new to the series or a fan of the series because you won't be disappointed.\"\n",
      " b'I can\\'t remember if Myst was my first PC game.  I know it was the one that got me hooked--to the point where I kept upgrading computers and peripherals just to keep up with the games.  I tried to replay Myst a year ago and found I couldn\\'t figure it out (have I lost that many brain cells over the years?), didn\\'t have the patience or something to keep at it.  But like a first love, I remember it very fondly and treasure it.  It\\'s almost heart breaking to think that some day soon, as Windows continues to do upgrade to different styles of OS, newbies won\\'t be able to experience Myst.  Just like so many young people will never know how it felt when rock\\'n\\'roll burst forth.  To confess, I liked the graphics in Riven better.  And I never liked Artus (whatever) or his two sons--thought they were all slackers and whiners with serious emotional problems.  I loved that you could not die and nothing attacked you--really allowed [me] to explore and indulge my curiosity.  Loved the details (little bugs that moved, atmosphere, just everything).  Sound effects and \"music\"--wasn\\'t Myst one of the first to put visuals and music together?  All in all, many good things started with Myst.  I know it was the first computer game that spent time and money on the graphics (something I always appreciated).  At most places, the game play wasn\\'t strictly linear so you could play in whatever order you wanted.  You could \"spin\" around and see everything.  It was totally mouse driven.  One feature I loved (but many others complained about) was that it was an empty world, you never had to/got to interact with anyone else in Myst; for me it was somewhere of my own where I could explore to my heart\\'s content, go back and walk around areas that I liked (like \"tree\" world (can\\'t remember it\\'s actual name) even after you finished that level.  It is an all \\'round beautiful game.'\n",
      " b\"But worth the additional if you didn't get in on this version befor eit was canceled. This plays all the PS games, and has nice extras.\"\n",
      " b'Love it!'\n",
      " b'Anarchy Online invaded my life for several months, unfortunately.  It was my first MMORPG so this game took me by storm at first, and exploring the beautiful world of Rubi-Ka was a long venture in and of itself.\\nThe skill system is great, combat is genuinely suspenseful and fun for the most part, and the people in-game were helpful and mature most of the time.\\nBut ultimately AO became nothing more than some idle chat with others and running on the leveling treadmill.  I would go to a mission booth, run to mission cave, finish it, go to shop, wash, rinse and repeat.  It can take a couple of hours early on to level up, and as it goes on it can take several hours at a time.  I felt like I was getting nowhere and the missions were incredibly repetitive and dull.  All of them looked the same and behaved the same, and you always fought the same handful of creatures or people.\\nTo add to the frustration Funcom constantly tinkered with the game\\'s balance, almost literally ruining the game with one patch, it created so many new bugs and problems people jumped ship big time.\\nI joined a guild which was nothing more than a private shopping chat channel and team matchmaker.  PVP action is filled with no-lifers who \"tweak\" their characters with the help of higher level players and \"implants,\" and Funcom has let this go on since the beginning.\\nThe game is repetitive, frustrating, buggy still, and has the worst lag of any online game I\\'ve ever played, that alone was enough to make me quit. I wanted to like the game and make it a long-term habit, but the game wouldn\\'t let me.\\nAnd judging from the new \"ideas\" being considered for the game this summer, I don\\'t see any hope for this game at all.'\n",
      " b\"I think Derek G missed the point.\\nYour farm workers stand in the flood and drowned because you haven't built a place for them to take the food. Simple really. That's what I love about this game.\\nEverything has a point  and a purpose. I've been playing for about two weeks straight now, 3-4  hours a day... I was very frustrated for the first 10 days or so and now  I've finally figured it out. Everything effects everything... If you want  to play a complete city building game, this is the one. Great graphics,  great cause and effect, and even the music doesn't get too annoying. You  will lose sleep over this game!\"\n",
      " b'Far Cry has extremely good graphics and excellent gameplay. The environment which you fight in is very different, because one does not associate paradise island with gorilla warefare. However, the combination gells nicely and creates a unique battle environment. The picture quality is awesome and the sound is good, especially with sound blaster or if you use headphones. You also have a variety of weapons to choose from, including; M16, Sniper Rifle, MP50, Desert Eagle, etc. and a mix of flash and frag grenades. The control system is also done very well, putting the most used bottons within comfortable reach of your finers. The game is very challenging however and i would recommend playing it on easy or moderate mode until you can improve your skills.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a graphically stunning single player FPS, with excellent and challenging gameplay, then Far Cry is for you.'\n",
      " b'It came in great and on time (actually a day before it was supposed to get here) and worked like a charm. It was cheap and totally worth it and I also got a couple games for Christmas (I am 16 going to turn 17 on Valentines Day) like Metroid Prime and Resident Evil and the best thing is that whoever had the memory card also had save data of those games and so I guess I could say I had one heck of a time pranking people that I beat the games in under an hour from when it came in the mail. xD'\n",
      " b\"I have dozens of GameCube games and this is just about my all time favorite. First of all the graphic (Lands) are fantastic. It is a nice long game with Many levels. Game play is smooth with plenty of weapons options. Bilbo is a little guy, but it doesn't make any difference to his abilities. I played this game all the way through with no help from cheats. It is very challenging. I recommend an ActionReply cheats disc though. It's great having unlimited lives.\\n\\nThere are many treasure chests throughout the levels. But they require lock picking to open. If you do it wrong you can be killed.\\n\\nThis was my least favorite part of the game. But can be over come with ActionReplay. In the lands you start in Hobbiton. This level, for anyone who loves the book, is especially nice. You even go in the Hobbit Hole. As the game progresses you go through\\n\\nCaves and Mines, Climb to the tops of Mountains, Go to Lake Town,\\n\\nSmog the Dragon's Lair and Much more. This is a great Action Platformer that touches on Role Playing.\"\n",
      " b\"This was my first game for the PSP.  I was amazed by the graphics on this game there great!  The tracks are great and very fun.  Though there aren't many tracks they still remain very fun anytime you play them.  The speed classes you can play are insane.  You start off pretty slow but every speed class is much faster than the last witch provides a good challege anytime.  The cars or pods or ships or whatever you wanna call the things you race are amazing.  It takes different skills to race each 1 so being good with 1 doesn't mean your a master of the game.  One of my favorite parts of this game is the downloads.  You can go online with this game and download new stuff like new tracks, racers, and wallpapers.  Overall this game is 1 of the best games for the PSP.  This is a must buy\"\n",
      " b'This is just okay.'\n",
      " b\"I can't even begin to say how much I'm disappointed in this game. YES, I've had it since release date and consistently play it. Huge street fighter fan and this game just makes me so sad.\\n1. Characters are all messed up feeling now. I used to play with Cammy a lot in old SF games, now I don't even use her because I don't like what they've done with her moves. Feels like they've made her bad. And I'm not even going to start on how bad Juri is.\\n2. Characters look awful. All of them look warped somehow, especially Ken whom they've had to remake a model for because of how bad he looked. Only Ryu and Chun-li look acceptable.\\n3. Work for colors now. Old games would either come with all the colors OR you'd have to play the game a lot and unlock colors for your costumes. Now you either have to buy it(nope) or attempt to get them in small amounts through survival.\\n4. No more arcade. I mean come on. When we weren't playing online or locally with others, chances are we were doing trials, training or doing arcade. Now that's been replaced with a boring story and they've only added trials far after release date so I'm not even counting that.\\n5. DLC. I mean I already don't like the game so paying for characters who should have been in the game from the start does not sit well with me. Yeah you have fight money but geezus you gotta grind all their crappy modes so hard just to try to scrap up enough for 2 characters and then you've pretty much screwed yourself out of buying a costume or something.\\n\\nMy love for SF hasn't made me lose hope yet, I'm really hoping for a Super SF V where they'll add new characters and make drastic changes to some of this stuff.\"\n",
      " b\"Now, as an extreme RF2 fan, I waited all summer for this baby. Since my sis' works at blockbuster, i got it early.\\n  GAMEPLAY: So far, the gameplay is very addictive and unorthodox unlike the first. You get anything you want in the game, sometimes you find out your inventory holds weapons that you never even knew. Fun and gory, much better than TUROK. GEO-MOD is still there, more sufficient and better than RF1.\\n  GRAPHICS: Cleaner than the first faction and no slow downs in multi-player. TIMESPLITTERS 2 was a little crude on the graphics. RF2 is a XBOX game on PS2 in my opinion.\\n  SOUND/MUSIC: The sound is perfect, smart [...] remarks and high tech noises, screams, yells, and shattering glass. NOW HERES THE DOWNFALL to the game, the music. Its not the sappy danger music in HALO, but safe and pointless music in RF2 or, Calypso.\\n  MULTIPLAYER: Three words, NO SLOW DOWNS! You got that a lot in the first one, but since the graphics are better, you don't get any of that, so don't worry about it.\\n  OVERALL: i'm gonna stick to my 5 out of 5 grade, because, it wasn't the beautiful graphics or weapons, or disgusting music, but the GEO-MOD! this is the only game with it, and this is what makes it fun! You can make your own bat caves, or holes in the ground so the bots can fall in them, this game is perfect! THE BEST GAME FOR PLAYSTATION 2 THIS SEASON!\\n  JOIN THE REVOLUTION\"\n",

      " b'Once the Mega Man franchise started to hit really big with Nintendo fans, each new installment of the series kept getting better and better.  Mega Man 3 introduces his robot dog companion, Rush.\\n\\nThis is probably my favorite installment of the six.  Mega Man 3 has a completely AWESOME soundtrack, most notably from Gemini Man, Magnet Man, Snake Man, and the BEST stage of all -- Top Man.  I didn\\'t like the Needle Man stage too much because he is such a headache.\\n\\nAfter you\\'ve beaten all of the 8 stages, you have to re-enter the Gemini Man, Needle Man, Shadow Man, and Spark Man levels which have been re-designed.  Twice in each level, you will have to face off with a robot mini-boss who \"absorbs\" the powers of the robots from Mega Man 2.  And he is extremely difficult to beat -- thank goodness for the energy tanks, huh?!\\n\\nWhen you face Dr. Wily on the very last level, you will need to use the Hard Knuckle to take away half of his energy.  Once he reveals his face, Snake Man\\'s weapon is the only one that is vulnerable to his ship.  Enjoy the great ending that follows, because he will return again in Mega Man 4 through 10 mwah hah hah!!  :)\\n\\nI truly wish there were some more Mega Man installments for the Nintendo 3DS or Wii U -- I have no idea why Capcom has not done that yet, so they are really keeping the fanatics waiting...oh well.'\n",
      " b'The Chronicles of Riddick- Escape From Butcher Bay(2004). Released on the XBox and PC(Since I couldn\\'t find the XBOX one I\\'m doing the PC review).\\n\\n In the past few years, the movie \\'Pitch Black\\' has been hailed as a masterpiece from Sci-Fi fans everywhere, so it\\'s no surprised that a sequel was made, starring, once again, Vin Diesel, entitled \\'The Chronicles of Riddick\\'. In sort of a movie marketing scheme, Starbreeze decided to release a video game that would be a prequel to \\'Pitch Black\\', entitled \\'Escape From Butcher Bay\\', which chronicles(pun alert) Riddick\\'s tenure at the Butcher Bay prison facility, and how he eventually escaped. Deciding to release it as a First Person Shooter, like the game \\'Halo\\', I was enclined to pick \\'Escape From Butcher Bay\\' after reading good reviews, and also that my favorite genre is First Person Shooters. So, did \\'Escape From Butcher Bay\\' live up to my expectations, or fail miserably? Read on to find out....\\n\\n Game Ratings-\\n\\n Graphics- Could they be any better? The dark, gritty atmosphere dominated by bump-mapping and beautiful character designs make this one big piece of eye candy. 5/5\\n\\n Play Control- The control is top-notch, as moving Riddick around, not to mention shooting, is a breeze, and I never found myself frustrated over the controls, except for the last segment where you piloted a Heavy Guard, but I didn\\'t care because it was so fun! 4.5/5\\n\\n Challenge- \\'Escape From Butcher Bay\\' is definitely a challenge, at some points making you face multiple guards with only your fists, but at other times you can find yourself breezing through the game. There are very intricate puzzles, and that\\'s what makes \\'Escape From Butcher Bay\\' tough. 5/5\\n\\n Storyline- \\'Escape From Butcher Bay\\' is fun go through, because of the cut-scenes! I love the plot, and its gritty realism coupled with harsh realities make it plausible, even if it\\'s not. Superb! 5/5\\n\\n Replay Value- Although playing through the game over and over would get old, you are enticed to go back through the game and collect \"Pack of Smokes\" cartridges which enable you to unlock special features. Not the greatest Replay Value, but not bad...3/5\\n\\n Sound/Music- \\'Escape From Butcher Bay\\' has great sound affects, and when the bullets are flying, you KNOW! Plus not to mention great voice-acting, and they got Diesel to even voice himself. Unless you care, there really isn\\'t any music, but it in no way takes away from the game! 5/5\\n\\n Fun- \\'Escape From Butcher Bay\\'\\'s undoubtable strong point is in its fun factor, and I found myself blasting through robots, guards, zombies, and mutated creatures to finish this game in 2 Days! You have an insanely fun time blasting your way through \\'Escape From Butcher Bay\\'!\\n\\n Overall, \\'The Chronicles of Riddick- Escape From Butcher Bay\\' sports excellence in every field, and this First Person Shooter is a masterpiece, and, while not being as good as \\'Halo\\', still gives the player an unmistakeable feeling of having fun as you blast your way through the game. This game gets very tough at times, and I suggest you pick up an Official Strategy Guide to solve the puzzles and get all the Packs of Smokes.\\n\\n HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF VIDEO GAMES EVERYWHERE!

WOW does it eat up slower systems.\\nI'm playing it on a Dell 8200, 2.8ghz, Geforce 4 Ti 4600, 512MB RDRAM, Windows XP PRO, and still had some slow spots.

      " b'This is one game I wish I had never sent money on. Don\\'t think I would want it even if it was free. In by opinion the game play is horrible and the controls make no sense. I got a PS4 for Christmas and I needed some games to play on it. Not many games really out there that are of interest to me but I got this, Watch Dogs, and The Last of Us games. The other two I liked but this one, after about 30 minutes into the game I turn it off and have not gone back. I found the game play to be frustrating. For example if you lose a \"boss\" fight you get sent back to the start and the Boss becomes stronger. I guess some would call that challenging but I don\\'t find that fun at all. I play games to relax after work not to be punished for losing a unreasonable uneven match in a video game. Oh did I mention that the boss\\'s have like 5 to 10 guys who all jump on you at the same time. If I want punishment I would just stay at work. But that is just me.

      " b\"I am an avid video gamer, I've been playing video games since the early 80's.  My love of RPGs came when the first Final Fantasy was released on the orignal nintendo system.  Since then, I have been hooked to the series, buying consoles for the games (PSone/FF7, PS2/FF10, PS3/FF13), not the other way around. After saying that, my all time favorite would have to be FF8.  The graphics are horrible in comparision to todays games, but the game play makes up for it.  Most RPGs have at least 20-40hrs of playing time, but with the FF series, I'm surprised if I spend less than 200+ hrs.  I have played through the entire game over three times over my lifetime, and for me, the most enjoyable part about this game would have to be the side quests and the addictive card game!  I am the type of person that has to have 100% completion before I move on to the next game, and was devastated when my six year old broke disk 4 of this game, hence the reason why I bought yet another copy.  I was tickled pink to find this game had become a classic, with a classic price!  Would've paid more money for the game but was ecstatic to only pay $14 for it!!\"\n",

      " b'I got this game when it first came out, it was quite buggy. Horribly buggy. Every time I played I ran into problems. I can\\'t say you will, they have patched the game a multitude of times now...\\n\\nSo, moving on, the game play is quite bland. You smash the attack button to crush your opponents, there\\'s no strategy involved. You just keep on hitting that button before your health runs out and you\\'re good to go throughout 100% of the game. The boss battle? (Spoilers ahead) There isn\\'t one.\\n\\nThe ending is very anti-climatic. The man who screwed with your life is a frail coward at the end and when you stand 7\\' over his teeny arse, there\\'s not much else to say other than there\\'s no contest. He\\'s been in his castle for the last 10-something years while you\\'ve been muscling up. Body builder vs. old-frail man.\\n\\nThe quests aren\\'t memorable at all. I can hardly remember any of them. They\\'re boring too. Don\\'t expect them to take long either if you play video games regularly. Most of them end badly because of glitches anyhow (as I said before, they probably patched some quests).\\n\\nThe whole marrying thing is quite annoying when you have two wives, they come over and argue with each other. Not to mention all my kids turned out to be... wait for it... black. Pitch black kids. I\\'m not talking \"African-American\" but the essence of the color black. They weren\\'t mine. One day they\\'re white kids, next day they\\'re black. I never understood why this happened, it just did.\\n\\nIt\\'s not a very good game. Don\\'t expect it to be anything like the first. They sold out big time to reach a larger audience. The gameplay is dumbed down, the story is a sack of bricks, and the co-op is not worth mentioning. It sucks.'\n",
      " b'Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is the third in a series of three games (to date).  It is available for the XBOX, Play Station 2, PC, Game Cube and Game Boy Advance.  This review is in reference to the XBOX version.\\n\\nThose who are familiar with the Splinter Cell series have come to expect a product that is fresh, innovative and truly ahead of the pack in terms of game play, graphics and all of the more technical aspects of a video game.  Chaos Theory not only lives up to, but exceeds those expectations.  Even though we have now entered the \"Next-Gen\" era, this game still outshines most of the other games currently available.  This is because Splinter Cell games are notoriously ahead of their time and implement the most advanced techniques and technologies available, even if it means creating them from the ground up.\\n\\nIn this third installation of the series the year is 2007. However, I\\'ll skip the obligatory plotline info and get straight to the guts of the game.  The single player mission is of course, utterly superb in every way imaginable.  I could go on telling you about all the intricate story, unbelievably beautiful lighting and particle effects, fluid game play and such, but, perhaps the most important thing is simply that it will literally be months before you stop saying \"these graphics are insane\" or \"OMFG, this game freakin ROCKS\"!  No joke, it\\'s that good.\\n\\nAlso included in the package is the multiplayer mode introduced in Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow.  The graphics have been updated and look great.  A few new gadgets have been introduced: the Mercs now have a camera network at their disposal, while the spies have a heart-beat sensor and the glorious therm-optic camouflage.  A few moves have also made an appearance: the Mercs have charge and berserk abilities while the spies are now able to pull foes over railings and execute an inverted hang.  Pandora Tomorrow would be worth the price just for the MP element.  But that isn\\'t all; once again, the bar has been raised and we are presented with something completely new and unexpected - Splinter Cell Co-Op mode.  In Co-Op you partner up with a friend via Xbox LIVE to take on computer AI throughout a number of well crafted missions for a completely new experience.  Chaos Theory is arguably the best in the series and undoubtedly the most addictive game I have EVER played - I still play it till this day.  Another classic stunner.'\n",

      " b\"By now, you have heard the hype surrounding Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion.  I am here to tell you that the hype is real.  The game is fantastic.  The graphics are unreal-they really took them to the next level.  The play mechanics are straight forward for the average PC RPG fan, but there is enough depth to make any hard core gamer happy!  I think the designers hit a perfect balance for any type of fan.\\n\\nAs computer owners, we are constantly reminded that it is expensive to upgrade hardware.  Every once and a while, a game comes out that justifies those expenses.  I think this is the game that should make people upgrade.  And, if you do it now, you won't have to worry about upgrading for the next generation of games.  My computer is plenty powerful enough to run it (Alienware Area-51 5500 with 1Gig Ram, ATI x850 256megs Ram, S-ATA 80 gig HD, Viewsonic VX924 Monitor).\\n\\nHowever, if my computer was too slow, I know I would upgrade in order to play this game, it is that good.  Even after a few hours of playing, I am confident in saying that this game is fantastic!  Any money you spend on your computer will be well worth it!\\n\\nThe beginning level acts as a tutorial. Instead of being ordered how to do things, the game starts open ended (a clue that the entire game will be this open ended as well).  It gives suggestions on things, such as how to use the bow and how to cast spells.  But if you choose to not be an archer or a magician, you can still proceed.  You customize your character at different points based on how you were playing.  I think that is an original design for character creation, as opposed to creating a character from scratch before ever playing the game.\\n\\nI have walked through several large cities, talked to citizens, obtained quests, finished quests, bartered at the shops, changed my equipment, leveled-up some skills, used swords, hammers, bows, magic, etc.-that was all in the first few hours.  I am taking my time walking through the game. Yes, the graphics are that good, and you may want to take the time to admire the world that you are walking through.  Personally, I sometimes rush through games and forget to look around at the world.  This game makes you want to look around, to see what is around the corner, to explore the areas and see what is next.\\n\\nOblivion is going to be huge!  I have read that the main quest is about 25 hours.  If you explore the entire island, and attempt the side quests, the game is hundreds and hundreds of hours.  I still know people playing Morrowind-I expect Oblivion to last as long, if not longer.\\n\\nYes, my computer is setup for games and the gaming experience. So far, Oblivion has proved to be a worthwhile experience.  Even for those computers with lower setting should still enjoy this game-the designers made sure that the game was just more than graphics. How it looks should not stop you from buying this game-it is the game experience you should come for.  The fact that it is possibly the best computer RPG ever should make you want to play it no matter what.\\n\\nThe bottom line is: combat is fun, and I look forward to unlocking skills that let me target with my bow, roll out of the way of combat, and summon creatures to help me fight.  The game play is deep and accessible.  There are more items, weapons, magic combinations, character types, NPCs, quests etc. than you know what to do with!  The graphics are outstanding.  The voice acting is some of the best in any game.  The game wants you, the player, to be involved.  You play however you want and whoever you want to be.\\n\\nAnd truthfully, the game is just fun.  What more can you ask for in a computer game?\\n\\nUPDATE: Someone wrote earlier that you can only play in 1st person. This is not true. Use the mouse wheel to scoll back and you can set the distance you want to view your character in 3rd person. Also, you can hot key 8 items (both on the PC and XBox 360) with keys 1-8.  I wish there were more, but it seems to be a strategy type thing set by the designers.  What is important to you? Well, you get 8 things to hot key.  The key F1-F4 call up your charater page, inventory, spells, and map/journal.  This should make inventory management a snap.  Hopefully, those who are making comments about these things either read their manauls or try things out before making it a negative complaint about the game.\\n\\nI started a new character already and I am enjoying the game so much more with this custome Battle Mage!  This game is great because it encourages experimentation and exploration. Enjoy!\"\n",

      " b'Wow!  This game is great!  I could not believe the first time I put this game in my X Box and set it off.  It truly is fantastic.  I first noticed the wonderful soundtrack.  The music continues on, and is not abrupt, when sinister things happen.  It reminds me of the background music you hear during scary movies like \"Psycho\" etc, when  you are watching the protagonist do something he or she is not supposed to be doing.\\n\\nFlying around is quite natural with the X Box controller.  In fact, it reminds me of the ease of most Sim racing games.  There is a bit of a learning curve learning about sighting enemies on the map, and flying around them to attack, but once you get the hang of it, you\\'re in like Flint.\\n\\nRecommended and enjoyed by my whole family, including a 5 year old.

I couldn't wait for the genesis version to come out. When it did I was not disapointed. Sure the graphics and melee attacks aren't completely the same. evertheless this was very close version to the arcade. It plays very similar especially if you have the Genesis arcade sticks!!!

      " b'I\\'ve always been a big fan of this game once I mastered all the controls. I\\'ve beat it at least 15 times (taking roughly 12 hours to finish each playthough) and still have found memories of this game. I found the more ancient setting of this game a refreshing change from typical star wars games as in this game, the presence of Dark Jedi were common and the galaxy was accustomed to fighting enemies. The worlds in the game are simple, but very fun and there\\'s even some good mods you should get out (pretty sure they\\'re only for the pc though). I also found it interesting how much personality is given to all the characters in here, even minor ones. Humorous situations appeared quite often. And then the big one, you can decide if you wish to play as a good or evil character (personally I love being mean as a bad guy).\\n\\nThere are some weaknesses, the game can feel repetitive after awhile, the last \"level\" of the game is just kill kill kill and it doesn\\'t do the best job of building up suspence. there really isn\\'t much reason to play as any character other than your own so leveling them up doesn\\'t feel that impressive, finally (this isn\\'t a true dislike) the differences between playing as a male or female and light and dark are not very different so playing it one way gives you most of what the game has to offer.\\n\\nStill, great job Bioware.'\n",

      " b\"When I first heard of Smackdown 2006 I was skeptical. How many improvements could be made to a game in a year that is usually only released every 2 to 3 years? The answer is A LOT!! The good people at THQ and Yukes must have been working on this game before they released last year's not so special Smackdown vs. Raw. The bottom line is Smackdown '06 delivers the most realistic (or should I say true to life) wrestling experience to date. This game simply blows every other installment of the Smackdown franchise out of the water in ALL departments (graphics, sound, fighting system, season mode, and new features).\\n\\nGraphics - First of all, the graphics look like something that belongs on a next generation system. I don't know how they did it but the wrestlers look so much like their real life counter-parts it is down right spooky. The first time I saw Triple H pause and throw his bottle of water into the crowd I got goosebumps because you'd swear you were watching real footage. Also there is no visual drop-off in the quality of created superstars, which is a first. The crowd models look better than ever and on some entrances you actually can see the other wrestler in the ring waiting for you (depending on if the camera angle is right) making the entrances look like much more then canned animation sequences.\\n\\nSound - Though most people don't by a wrestling game for it's sound the commentary is much better than it has ever been. It's still repetitive at times but even Madden games haven't solved that problem yet. The voice overs for the wrestlers are delivered much better then last years and created wrestlers can be assigned voices as well as a voiced, name and city for their entrance.\\n\\nFighting System - Now down to the brass tacks. It may look and sound good but what about the fightin'?!! Fans of last year's game may be in for a disappointment this year because the overhauled fighting system is much more reminiscent of Smackdown: Here Comes The Pain in terms of pacing. The matches have been slowed down quite a bit to allow for a more tactical approach and to reflect the real pace of a real life match. The computer reverses moves much more than ever which can be frustrating at times but this simply forces players to use a little more variety in their tactics than they are use to. ALSO the biggest change is NO MORE ENERGY BARS. Matches are won by wearing down your opponent by targeting you attacks to a specific area of their body and by swing the momentum of a match (by dominating your opponent by chaining moves together and gaining crown approval). This fighting system, while slower and more deliberate, is true to life wrestling experience.\\n\\nSeason mode - The season mode visuals are much better this year along with the previously mentioned voice-overs. Cut scenes look like something you'd see on a WWE program, with changing camera angles, and compelling acting (wink, wink). There are wrestler specific branches that should keep the repetition to a minimum.\\n\\nNew Features - Finally there are more features than you can shake a barbed wires bat at. New match types including the buried alive format. A GM mode that mirrors the GM modes we've seen in other sports games and a beefed up online mode that supports 4 players and tradeable created wrestlers.\"\n",

      " b\"If you are not technically minded, don't buy this game.  If you don't know the difference between a directX 9 card and a directX 9 compliant card (one works with DirectX 9 but does some of it in software and is useless for many modern games), don't bother.  If you have a computer that is not correctly configured, don't even think about it.  If you expect to run the game and play well within an hour, stop reading now.\\nNow for the rest of us, the ones who are sick of console games and know how to build their own machines so that they run well, irrespective of the age of the components.  The ones who are prepared to sit down and actually learn how to use a program, and know that a third party manual is the only way to even begin to do justice to this simulation (it is *not* a game)...  This one is for you.\\nRuns well on my 9500 pro (heavily overclocked, with an artic cooler mod), XP2000+ processer and 1Gb RAM and with all of the simulation settings set to high except water quality and view distance (set to low and medium respectively) - as per the manual recomendations (hint for all the folks with low frame rates!).  Mine is not a high end machine, but I took pains to work out what the most stable drivers were for everything before installing this game (catalyst 3.7 for the video, plus latest VIA sound drivers for my onboard audio), because I knew it would be a demanding game... not on hardware, but on software configuration.  Mid range hardware seems okay on all the latest games, but it is drivers and general software config that causes problems, ddespite what some of the other reviewers seem to think.\\nKnow what?  It worked first time, and it worked well.  I'm enjoying going through the LOMAC manual (the one published by Digital Aspirin), learning how to play this beast, and when you get into the zone it is absolutely great.\\nFor example, in one mission, I am tasked with shooting down a valuable and well protected AWACs plane that is patrolling off the coast.  It is protected by a pair of F4s and there is a patroling squad of F16s nearby.... all of which totally outclasses and outguns my pair of MiGs.  So its a case of tactical flight - flying undetected with stealth (passive non-emitting sensor modes), and a BVR attack on the AWACS from behind, placing the F4s in a position where they are furthest away from my escape vector when I de-cloak and initiate the attack.  Following my stike on the AWACS, I head for the deck running, using the mountains as cover and using the low level air density to significantly cut missile range (yes, it even models that!).  A long chase follows, with the two F4's and my wingman buying it in a short but fast dogfight, when the F4s elect to cut their altitude for speed and catch up.  But I make it home, low level all the way to avoid lock-ons by the F16s, who were following at high altitude taking BVR pot-shots.\\nExhilarated is the only word I can use when I made it to my side's air defences, and watched the F16s turn and sulk back home...  Mission Accomplished!\\nNow that's gameplay.\\n\\nS\"\n",

      " b'I admit... when I first heard about FF8 I was skeptical. I thought \"How could Square match FF7?\" Doubtless I still wanted the game so I placed my reserve on the game about 1 month in advance. So the day of September 9, 1999 came (the whole 9-9-99 thing) and I got it. I popped it in and instantly was blown away. I saw the opening seen and knew right then, that the \"mature anime\" of the characters were amazing. I mean you see the detail that Square includes in just the opening sequence and you are amazed. So I played for a while and put it away till Christmas. (school started) I pulled it back out at Christmas time and decided to play. I got through the first disc that day and then I sat around for hours just playing Triple Triad. For those of you who do not know what it is, it is a sort of CCG in the videogame. Once you start though it just takes up tons of time and it is totally amazing how ingrosing this \"game inside a game\" is. I loved getting all the GF cards and the Main character cards and such. I just want to say if you get the chance to buy this game, then devote hours to Triple Triad just like all of us devoted hours to Gold Saucer. Other than that the new \"junction system\" is the new form of Magic/Summon. You junction GF to you which gives you abilities, higher attack/magic points, and other stuff like that. You have to draw magic from animals in the world around you. It\\'s that it just makes you wonder where they got the magic from? The best part about this game though is the amazing Storyline. It changes a whole lot and like most RPGs this one lives off of it\\'s storyline. If you are a Final Fantasy Fan or just an RPG or Videogame fan then treat yourself to this 4 disc monster. You will not be sorry.'\n",
      " b'I loved the original Kane and lynch because I connected well to the story.  The game play of the origninal was not that great for a PS3 generation game but the story in coop mode was simply great.  Breaking into jail, the night club scenes were epic.  Dog Days simply had no story.  The guns seemed better and the game play better, but from scene to scene, the story was incoherent and I lost interest.  When the game ends, me and my friend said \"what...that was it?\"  The campaign was short, like real short.  My friend and I are experienced FPS players (but have a life outside of video games) and we beat the game on hard difficulity in about 4 hours, which is ridiculous. I know some will like this game but I felt cheated out of $60. I will say this, the game is real hard this time around on extreme.  Hit detection is poor for human players but excellent if not unreal for AI. I mean you die with two bullets. There is no scope on guns and no grenades; you throw canasters instead. After you heal your partner you automatically stand up and may get shot if not killed (there is no way to change this).\\n\\nThe multiplayer is entertaining.  Fragile alliance gets you paranoid that one of your fellow gamers are going to kill you for the money.  However, it\\'s not my style and I am not a fan of the gameplay of this game.  What hooked me was the origninal\\'s story line, which Dog Days lacked.  I just called GameStop to ask how much the game was worth (within the first week of purchase) and it was $22 with edge called.  That ought to tell you something because most games like Bad Company 2 was $40 credit months after release.  I do not recommend this as a purchase but maybe a rent.'\n",
      " b\"It's rare for me to spend a lot of time on any one game; I'm just not a huge gamer.  That said, I've recently been picking up a few Gamecube games for my Wii, and Paper Mario TTYD blew me away.\\n\\nGameplay is fairly simple and easy; the turn-based battles are great for someone like me who won't spend hours trying to master perfect button sequences to launch special moves.  The characters are entertaining, and at times it seems more like reading a novel than playing a game, one that the writers had a lot of fun with (I've found myself laughing at the game more than once).\\n\\nI'm about 20 hours into the game and I would consider this one of the top 3 video games I've ever played.  I'm definitely looking forward to checking out Super Paper Mario after I finish.\\n\\nEdit: I've long since finished the game (it took about 50 hours, I think...time well spent!)  I now have several dozen Wii titles, but with the exception of Wii Sports and Trauma Center, none of them even come close to this game.  (Including, unfortunately, Super Paper Mario; it was a neat idea, but the execution falls far short of Thousand Year Door).  If you have a Wii or Gamecube and don't mind reading well-written dialogue, you -need- this game.\"\n",

For starters, they got tones of details in the appearance of the game wrong. Ratchet and Clank aren't correct, and the sound quality is just garbage. I get that it is a psp game ported to the ps2, but I don't think that they even tried to make it good. The game play is super broken as is the camera. They didn't try to scale up the graphics for the console release. The plot is garbage. Normally, I don't pass judgement on a game until I have beat it, but this one is so bad that I am making an exception. This one is not even worth giving a try. It is pure garbage.\"\n",

It\\'s a remake of the Super Nintendo game \"Kirby\\'s Adventure\",by the way.\\n\\nYou play as the iconic pink puffball that is Kirby,in all his awesomeness.'\n",
      " b'This game is a must have for fans of the series and far outclasses the first outing on the Gameboy (The Huge Adventure).  The sound effects and music is varied and faithful to the previous games, and the graphics look amazingly good for a handheld.\\nFor those who haven\\'t played any of the previous games in the series, they all have similar plots and gameplay elements.  For various reasons, the bad guys want some crystals from the levels.  Crash collects the crystals and during the course of the game foils their unspecified evil plans.  Along the way are items for him to collect like fruit stored in boxes.  Collecting 100 pieces of fruit gets a free guy.  There are masks to collect that give him a 1 time shield, and once in a while there is a free guy in some of the boxes.  The levels are organized into areas, and completing each area requires \"beating the boss\".  Each boss has some sort of weakness you have to figure out.  After beating each boss, Crash acquires another ability like extra-high jump or extra-long sliding.\\nAfter you have collected the crystals, more game play is squeezed out in 2 ways - gems and relics.  Gems are collected either by breaking all the boxes in a level or sometimes they are hidden in a secret area in the level.  The game tells you before you enter a level which items are still available to collect.  Each level also has a target time for completion.  After you have collected the crystal, you can reenter a level, touch a clock then start racing through.  By going as fast as you can and beating the target time, you win a Relic.\\nMost of the levels are similar to previous games but there are a few new twists.  There are levels where Crash is water skiing and a big chompy shark is chasing him (hint: control Crash with the L&R buttons instead of the D-pad).  These levels remind me of the jet-ski levels I didn\\'t enjoy on previous games but the water skiing is actually fun.  Other new twists are flying on a little helicopter pack and a magic carpet.\\nI\\'m not sure if the game could be played through by young children without help as some of the levels are pretty hard.  Notably, the 3rd boss level is a difficult.  There is a 2nd crash on the screen making mirror moves to him.  By much trial and error I figured out you have to run the right-side Crash into the traps to win.  I don\\'t think my 6 year old could ever finish that level.\\nThey have recreated the levels from The Wrath of Cortex where Crash is rolling around in a glass ball called the Atlasphere.  These levels were the some of the most enjoyable in The Wrath of Cortex.  On the N-Tranced, they seem to be the same track every time with new obstacles thrown in.  These levels become a little frustrating because it is fairly easy to roll the ball off the side.  They can only be beaten by creeping through the level with your finger on the brake button.  I could have lived with fewer of these.'\n",

The hidden jumps to be done with all manner of vehicles and the taxi/paramedic, etc missions mean the game really is so open ended.\\n\\nIt's been three years and I'm still exploring Vice City.\\n\\nClassic!\"\n",
      " b'I\\'ve been playing this year\\'s version of Madden nonstop for about two months now and indeed it is a very great game.  Everyone already knows this.  But this review is for me to rant my dislikes of the game.  Although the defense has been completely revamped sometimes it seems as if the game is cheating.  Let me explain...the linebackers in this game are among the greatest ever.  They blanket fast wide receivers, cut on a dime, have DB like motions, excellent hand eye coordination, read routes in zone all dat, tackle everything etc.  But it gets to the point where they are breaking on outs WAY WAY TOO FAST.  They\\'ll get out there and cover the out route on a receiver like they were Deion Sanders.  Sometimes they\\'ll run the route for the receiver even breaking at the same time or even before the receiver does.  Ok that\\'s not that unrealistic but then they won\\'t JUST knock it down, they\\'ll cut the corner (like they have DB speed!) jump ten feet in the air and pick it off.  And when they catch they\\'re already 5 yards away from the reciever!  Sometimes I had a LB cover my slot receiver on a fly with no safety help and a play action.  Unrealistic.  That\\'s strictly for the DB\\'s.  And when you do run it the lb\\'s are in the backfield before you can hand it off but when you pass they all in the passing lanes.\\n\\nAnd speaking of Dbs, their play is amazing.  DB\\'s break on the ball incredibly fast...not unrealistic yet...but when you throw in a pump fake they don\\'t even bite...and if you think you have your receiver open deep?  Forget about it...no matter the speed of your receiver the DB is always running step for step and they will, while runnin full speed trying to keep up, jump a 45 inch vertical flail around and knock the ball ( 100% of the time is underthrown by a human) down in single coverage.  If it is a safety overtop forget about it because he\\'s never late breaking to that and almost always will knock it down or pick it off no matter if there\\'s a post coming at him.  And if you do throw the post he\\'s all over that as well knocking it down.\\n\\nAnd another thing when it\\'s pass the D Line handles your o line tossing them around like ragdolls penetrating 3 yards in the backfield as soon as the ball is snapped forcing you to throw quick or scramble.  And if they blitz outside expect your tackle to be dumber than a box of rocks and let NOT ONLY ONE BUT TWO defenders run right by him and won\\'t even attempt to lunge or nothing and let them kill my qb all game.  One thing that has been left out is that forward motion of the arm when the QB is hit and fumbles.  If your QB gets hit while throwing it\\'s almost always ruled a fumble and they scoop it up score.  Your O Line, knowing that they let somebody through, won\\'t come back and try to block the man so when it is a fumble they don\\'t even know what\\'s going on.  One time I got sacked and fumbled, ball was on the ground for like 2 or 3 seconds and not one O linemen turned around.  The QB was just laying there like a fool and didn\\'t even attempt to get the ball back knowing that he just dropped it.  At least try to trip em up or something.  And guess what they ended up running for a touchdown. And when you do throw the whole secondary and LB\\'s show up for the tackle..swarming.  If the computer gets hit while throwing the pass will still be completed 80% of the time.  No break on the ball by your DB.\\n\\nThis wouldn\\'t be so bad if your team did the same thing.  But unfortunately they do not.  You wanna man up a receiver with Chris McCallister?  No way.  Try to bump that receiver and he gives my CB a move and more often than not catches a slant or he gets beat deep even with the safety over the top he outruns everyone.  If you Try to manually control the CB and do as the computer does and jump ten feet high, and they\\'ll just put their hand up still allowing them to catch it.  Sometimes they go up to bump a receiver and the receiver runs right around them.  That\\'s not that bad...you can\\'t get hands on them every play but the separation is like 5 or 6 yards when they miss and the computer ALWAYS hits the man that misses the bump.  It\\'s crazy.  Playing regular man with no variation causes your corner back to get torched underneath but they are pretty good at not getting beat deep.  Playing off man is death unless they got a long way to go in a very short period of time.  So man isn\\'t working let\\'s go to a zone.\\n\\nZone coverages more often than not work.  But if you get a play action expect your cover 3 corner to commit the number one cardinal rule in defensive back history; he\\'ll get beat deep in cover 3.  Doesn\\'t matter how fast your CB is the WR will eat up his cushion and will be next to him before he even turns to run and by that time the WR is already by him.  The safety done bit on something and the computer more often than not throws a perfect pass right over the WR\\'s shoulders catching it in full stride and making your CB look stupid.  I\\'ve had this happen to me numerous times with like 10 seconds to go in the half, and they score on that BS.  Part of the reason your DB\\'s and LB\\'s don\\'t break on the ball like the computer\\'s is because the D Line is gettin mudded every play.  Their O line will pick up every blitz on all madden and will sometimes even pancake the blitzer and go pick up someone else. On the run they\\'re pushing the line of scrimmage up three yards at the snap of the ball.  I mean they are getting blown off the ball...no penetration.\\n\\nAnd if you think your LB\\'s will look up receivers and jump routes forget it.  You selling yourself wolf tickets.  They will let a WR run through three zones across the field and catch the ball right in front of them.  They usually drop to certain depths so when there\\'s no underneath threat shouldn\\'t they be looking for the deep in as the computer does?  Well...they SHOULD.  I find the computer catching 16 yard routes that would more often than not get PICKED when I run the same play.  And again no break on ball by safeties.  And in cover 2 the WR will run a 7 route and the safety won\\'t move off the hash!  What\\'s going on?!?!  Even with all that the game is very fun to play.  I can\\'t put it down...even though the game cheats it doesn\\'t cheat so much to make you wanna throw a controller if ya feel me.  I mean they\\'ll do a play and you\\'ll think to yourself \"The game is cheating!\" , but then you realize in the NFL people make spectacular plays or screw up and blow a coverage every now & then and the offense happens to exploit it, or they miss tackles.  Or they watched that film and they know that route and that reciever\\'s tendencies.  So all in all...Madden is still madden...great gameplay, franchise mode, and head to head competition.  Fluid controls and good animations and graphics.  To me, it\\'s better than ESPN football but hey that\\'s just one man\\'s opinion.\\n\\n*****additions******\\n\\nDB\\'s break on the ball TOO FREAKING FAST!!!!!!!! One time I had a fly route and a post corner on the same side and the DB, with his back turned, somehow with his spidey-sense, sensed that the ball was being thrown to the post corner. He stopped on a dime, left the man he was guarding broke on the post corner and picked it off...almost took it to the crib. and the DB wasn\\'t no Chris McCalister or Champ Bailey or Deion Sanders or Patrick Surtain or Will Allen...it was just some nobody. Everything is knocked down or picked off even when it\\'s completely apparent that the receiver is open. DB\\'s on deep balls jump (on time) before they even turn their head around and even before the reciever jumps and knocks the ball down. On top of that your receiver rarely even jumps...he just puts his hand up like the ball will magically fall into his hands. Even when you manually take control of the reciever the DB out jumps him while running full speed and not even looking at the ball. I\\'ve played cornerback and I know that you CANNOT jump that high unless you stop and plant and at least have an idea on where the ball is. You can\\'t run full speed, jump ten feet in the air without looking for the ball AND knock it down 90% of the time and you don\\'t even see the ball. You just can\\'t do it. When have you ever seen a cornerback just out jump a receiver while looking at the ball let alone while he\\'s trying to catch up to the receiver? That\\'s right never. But when the computer throws a fade on your guy he doesn\\'t even put his hand up and gets burnt on a straight fly and the receiver is not Moss. When have you seen man to man CB just simply get ran right past and burnt by five yards by a WR who is not faster or better than him? That\\'s what happened to me. Chris McCalister on Hines Ward...he should be locked down. QB throwing perfect passes. Linebackers freakin manned up with a reciever (with no safety help overtop) on the post corner and jump 1000 feet in the air and break up the pass. And to make it so bad the QB underthrows it even when you step into the throw and the blitz is minimal.\\n\\nAnd speaking of blitzing...I may blitz seven people and just so happens everyone gets picked up. Once I blitzed 7, and the QB had time to PUMP FAKE and still get the throw off and complete the pass! What is that? But the computer might blitz three or four and the tackle won\\'t even attempt to lunge at the Defensive End... it\\'s really pitiful sometimes. And on running plays often not one but two blockers will run right by the guy that makes the tackle like they didn\\'t even see him and on stretch plays the MLB will run right through the A gap untouched and tackle me the same time I get the ball (more than a couple times a game). I was playing the Steelers on all madden on 15 minute quarters to learn a new playbook and in the first quarter I was sacked 12 times and threw 6 interceptions and they had 6 tackles for loss. Jamal Lewis had like 90 yards on 15 carries and they still didn\\'t even bite on the play action. That\\'s just BS. And speaking of BS...how does a corner playing man to man bite on a play action? Someone please enlighten me. And on a play action how is my RB gettin tackled 8 yards down the field and no Pass Interference is called? And out routes are pretty much useless because the defensive players break on the ball too fast. Once I was on the goaline and ran a play action pass to Todd Heap, and the Steelers fourth string defensive end dropped in coverage but bit on the play action. Clearly beat, I lob the ball to Todd Heap in the corner of the endzone and amazingly the fourth string D. End ( rating is like 70) jumps off one foot and knocks a fade down in the corner of the endzone. That\\'s when I just turned the game off. It made me mad to no end (it was fourth down!) yall wouldn\\'t understand how mad that made me---cursing at the tv and everything! (This was today by the way) And when you do finally deliver the ball what do they do? They drop it (most likely a first down pass)! Most of the time without getting hit. But Burress comes through on a slant and stiff arms Ray Lewis and drags Boulware three yards down the field. WTF?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? They had Duce Staley break THREE yes THREE hit sticks in one play from first Ray Lewis (impossible!), then Ed Reed (a pro bowler), THEN anthony weaver and was finally ankle tackled by willie Demps. Sorry but Duce staley is not that good anymore.\\n\\nAnd speaking of broken tackles...expect at least one person on your kickoff team to miss a tackle and everybody else get blocked. But when they kickoff to you, your lone returner is left to fend off five defenders cus nobody on your team tried to block. And if they do happen to block and all you need is that one missed tackle...forget it your guy\\'s goin down. In all my games of Madden 05 I have returned not ONE kickoff or punt (against the computer). I can barely average 18 yards a return. That\\'s unnrealistic. I\\'ll still play the game tomorrow though...what a game what a game.'\n",

There are also batting practice and Home Run Derby  modes.  Man, I\\'ve had this game a week and I already know my girlfriend  will kill herself for buying it for me. :)\\nBottom line: Great graphics.  Stellar gameplay.  Incredible depth, plus infinite tweaking available in  the tune.txt file.  This game has it all, and I suspect I\\'ll be playing it  even more than I played HardBall!.'\n",
      " b\"I'll give you my review of this product first, than my gaming background and finally my favorite PS3 and PC audio setup.\\n\\nThe Tritton AX PRO had allot potential with all the adjustable levels for each channel. Being able to adjust timing/power to every channel sounded like a great idea for COD, but at the cost of sound clarity and realism.\\n\\nSound Quality. The sound is rather dull. The lows are ok, mids are muffled, highs are more like mids and muffled, bass is lacks the thump and snap. This is due to the design and drivers used. Changing the delay/power will decrease the realism and quality of the sound.\\n\\nSurround sound. It could be better, but due to the bad sound quality and design its just ok. A Virtual surround sound processor is a better solution.\\n\\nBuild  . The headphones seem to be strong, but the plastic used is super hard and brittle. (easy to break) The ear muffs are a little hard and not thick enough. The headset is too stiff.\\n\\nPROs:\\nLooks kinda cool.\\nLot of functions\\n\\nCons:\\nDull Lows/Mids/Highs/Bass. Its NOT clear or natural sounding.\\nNot very comfortable\\nFlawed design\\nNot very portable/versatile.\\nComplex functions/tweaking.\\n\\nOverall.\\nNo Buy. The features hurt the sound quality more than it helps. The sound is dull and NOT crisp or clear. The headset is not very comfortable or portable and has allot of cables and is rather difficult to optimize. The headset looks alright but I would not recommend this headset.\\n\\nNote I'm not going to get into how to properly setup the time delay for each channel and what each color means. You can always check youtube and google for that.\\n\\nA secondary option in the $140 range with a better build/sound/comfort is the SteelSeries Siberia v2 with the Turtle Beach DDS 7.1 (NOT DDS2)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMy Background.

DDS2 is 4.1 and has a worse processor chip) DDS will allow you to get virtual 5.1/7.1 surround sound through any speaker/headphone/earbud with a 3.5mm plug. It has optical spdif in and also 3.5mm in. Its powered by usb to mini usb cable(same as ps3 controller)and has a pass through for any other usb device. You may get background noise because of harddrive and other elctrical noise, but it is minimal and depends on the dds and ps3 you have. To bypass this you could buy a external battery for a cellphone that has a usb out. This would power the dds without any electrical interference.\\n\\nWith the SteelSeries Cross plateform AudioMixer you have separate volume control for game and chat and also a fade function for chat. It will automatically lower the game volume for chat when someone talks. I turn it off though. Mic mute option.\\n\\nLow BASS Option: The AD700 headphone is my favorite headphone. Its so comfortable, it's like wearing earmuffs. The sound is so crisp and clear. Great build quality and awesome cord. Just lacks a little in the bass.\\n\\nGood BASS Option: The ATHM50S headphone is a great value and better than Beats. Its got great bass and crisp n clear audio. Good build quality and awesome cord.

HT Omega uses the C-Media Oxygen HD CMI8788 Audio Processor. Both are good, but the asus has an standalone power connection and an electrical noise filtering system. If you buy the asus, make sure you throw the driver disc away and download the latest drivers and install it. Both have Dolby Headphones , virtual 7.1 and PL IIx. Both are good options.

      " b'If you have been looking for a great two player RPG for your xbox, look no further. It has arived with Dark Alliance.\\nI have been reading some of the other reviews. The other reviewers are correct in that the game has limited (literally three) character choices (a dwarf fighter, human archer, or elf mage). You don\\'t even get to choose their name or roll their stats. HOWEVER...the characters are customizeable as you raise levels. Each time you level you obtain feat points which can be added to a skill of your choice. For example, if you are playing the archer character, you can put feat points onto a skill which raises your hit and damage with arrows, or a skill which allows you to carry more equipment, or a flame arrow spell. Every four levels you get to add one point to an ability score of your choice. This in itself allows a lot of customization.\\nGameplay is comparable to games such as Diablo2, but with much better graphics. I would liken the graphics to the movie Final Fantasy.\\nNow...if you want to replay the entire game with one of your high level characters you can. All you have to do is start a new game and import the high level character from your other saved game. This allows you to raise to as high a level as you want, as you can get experience points galore.\\nThere are three difficulty levels to start. If you complete a challenge mode called \"The Gauntlet,\" (which I think is way too hard. ...) you can access two higher difficulty modes. I have not yet unlocked them but I am guessing that they have extremely powerful magic items.\\nOne complaint I have is that the game strays a lot from the real rules of Dungeons and Dragons 3rd edition. While many things are the same, many more are far different. For example, you can obtain a weapon which does over 100 points of base damage! The armor class system apears to be the same at first, but later on you find full platemail +5 which adds 44 points to your armor class!\\nIf you play the sorcoress, the most powerful spell is a new spell called \"Ball Lightning.\" Almost all the spells are damage spells, such as magic missile, fireball, cone of cold, Melf\\'s acid arrow, and even meteor swarm. This sort of turns the sorcoress into a walking artillery piece. None of the many useful spells which do not damage, such as invisibility or hold person are obtainable.\\nDespite its drawbacks, you just can\\'t beat playing a coop RPG with amazing graphics. I would highly recommend it.'\n",

      " b'This was the LONGEST the MOST FUN game I have ever played! And, mind you, I am not an easy customer (feel free to browse through my reviews, you will see what I mean...)\\n\\nThe original BG series was excellent in all of storyline, gameplay, music and stability. Now, nowadays, sequels usually mean a graphically-improved expansion (at best). BG2 is a rare exception of the sequel clearly SURPASSING the original. And in the case of such great original, this means a lot!\\n\\nWords fail to describe the perfect harmony of brilliant ideas, interweaved story-lines and detailed coding that makes this game an unsurpassable classic! Do not let the slightly outdated graphics discourage you. They were cutting edge only some years ago - and you will be able to unleash their full potential even on mid-range PCs!\\n\\nI have yet to meet anyone who has played it and not raved about it! Hard-core D&D funs will find the character building, fighting checks and balances and overall experience very close to the actual pen-&-paper games.\\nCasual computer gamers will notice none of the tedious stuff of other cRPGs as the gameplay runs smooth and beautifully.\\nYou even have the choice to turn it into either a turn-based or an action game by tweaking the auto-pause options! I am telling you: this is how computers games should be!\\n\\nYou will let yourself get lost in the deep dungeons of the labyrinthic story; you will be laughing out loud to the humorous dialog; you will be surprised as to who is a double and triple-agent.\\nThere is an evil beyond imagining unleashed and only you with your party can stand in its way.\\nParty members offer a multitude of unpredictable balancing points and diverging story-lines of their own: side quests, conflicts and love affairs enrich the story in so many original ways!\\n\\nAn unsurpassed classic!\\n\\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!'\n",

The only thing missing is gaining gil after every battle, and not being a be able to choose your party leader for the major portion of the game.  I don't mind it being linear but being able to change leaders would have been nice to have through out the whole game.  I really like the main character lightning.  She's awesome like cloud was. Overall, this game is awesome and its a definite buy.  Dont miss out on this one.\"\n",
      " b'Splinter Cell is an game that requires you to use stealth to creep past guards and other characters to accomplish your anti-terrorism covert operations. The graphics are highly detailed and the game world is a realistic story of geopolitical events unfolding on a CNN-like news channel.\\nYou play Sam Fisher, a Third Echelon operative, sent on several missions to accomplish undercover missions to save the world. You must complete some missions without any weapons, and others with some James Bond type gadgets.\\nI haven\\'t finished the game yet, but I\\'m right at the end. It has an interesting storyline, without getting into too much detail or long cut scenes.\\nPROS:\\n * Great graphics. The dark atmosphere of shadows and shade make for an interesting game.\\n * Great Sound. The voice work and sound effects are done correctly and add to the excitment of the game.\\n * Good Controls. I never read the instructions, and I was able to quickly work out the controls. The very first mission is designed to train you as a \"new agent\" on the controls.\\n * Exciting Missions. The missions are constructed to force you to use your stealth skills to complete the mission. Some missions you are not allowed to kill anyone.\\nCONS:\\n * Downloadable Missions. They claim that you will be able to download additional missions in FEB. 2003 if you have XBox Live. I want to see those extra missions on a disk.\\n * Some of the graphics are weaker than others. The cut scene videos show people with only three fingers and a thumb. The two middle fingers are somehow glued together to form a single large finger. Sometimes, when you lay a knocked out guard down next to a wall, when you go to the other side of the wall you can see his head or arm sticking out of the wall. These are both minor items.\\n * Somethings the missions can be long, without a full explaination of how to complete each stage of the mission. I found my self having to try a few different things to determine what I was supposed to do to finish the mission.'\n",

      " b\"This game has about 300 hours of gameplay, and thats just if you move right on through the story and side quests. If you actually intended to have any fun playing this game, you would explore the giant island and visit it's many cities. You can also join different factions to open up even more missions. Some of the factions include The Imperial Legion, The Fighters Guild, The Thieves Guild and the Mages Guild. Each faction has a special bonus that will be available to you once you join it. For example: If you join The Thieves Guild, you can talk to certan people to clear a price on your head for half the amount of money. The only complaint I can muster is the combat, which is almost impossible at the beginning of the game. You start out in a city called Seyda Neen on the south coast of the massive island. I went from house to house stealing gold. Then I went to the trade house, sold the stolen items and purchased a brand new steel shortsword. Feeling all powerful with my new weapon, I started to make my way down a path leading out of the city when I came across my first opponent: a worm about the size of a football. Needless to say, I was not very impressed with it's weak attacks. However, when I tried to attack it, I couldn't hit it. This fight went on for a fairly long time untill I was forced to run away from the worm as it had taken almost all of my health and I still had not even hit it. In real life, I could have just stepped on it. After you level up a few times, fighting isn't so bad. Another minor problem is the time it takes to load when you start the game up again or when you reload a saved game or something. I used a timer and found that it took aprox. 1 minute and 52 seconds to load one of my saved games. However, considering how huge the game is, it's worth it. Among the many cities, there are also old ruins, abandon mines, ancient tombs (filled with unfriendly ghosts and walking skeletons with weapons) ,caves, shipwrecks, small tribes of the native people called Dunmer who live in camps far away from cities, bandit hideouts, and tons more. There are also strange ruins of ancient cities that belonged to the dunmer hundreds of years before their home was colonized by the mainland empire. The ruins are filled with things like strange robots, giant mounted crossbows, and many other strange (and valuable) machines and artifacts. The map is so amazingly diverse one can't even imagine how long it took to make it all. I've had the game for about nine months and I haven't even explored half of it. And, unlike Fable in which you can't step over 2-foot tall rocks that line paths, you can travel anywhere you want.\"\n",

      " b\"I found myself in a predicament on whether to buy Monster's, Sony's, or Interact's S-video cables and decided to go with these because of its advanced technologies (nitrogen gas!) and toughness. And let me tell you, these cables improve the way you see games and movies dramatically. In GT3, the colors looked much sharper and the blurry font became crystal clear in comparison to ordinary AV cables and the RFU adapter. On the other hand, if you have a RGB(component) video output, go with those instead(Monster's of course) because you can even get a better picture than S-video, albeit not a significant one I might add. But trust me, I gaurantee you'll see a big difference between ordinary RCA and S-video. Also, heed David Akumura's(another reviewer)advice about hooking up these cables to your receiver in conjunction with the optical cable to get the best possible picture and sound from your PS2 'cause I have that same type of hook up.

      " b'I am a sucker for all things Mario, and I love a good platformer game. I have been bored to death lately with the so-called \"New\" Super Mario Bros series-- after playing NSMB Wii, Wii U, DS and 3DS, and Luigi U... I\\'m a bit burned out on these \"New\" Mario games that are essentially all the same.\\n\\nI got Super Princess Peach for something different. Yes, it\\'s a little easier compared to your standard Mario game, but I don\\'t count that as a bad thing in this case. Here\\'s a short breakdown of what I like about Super Princess Peach:\\n\\n1) No time limit on the levels. You can take your time and explore as long as you like.\\n2) Plenty of hidden items to find. Toads trapped in boxes and puzzle pieces are the big things that come to mind, though there are a few little things like musical scores.\\n3) Lots of unique abilities (her \"vibes\")\\n4) Big, colorful levels with lots of area to explore.\\n5) Nice music that in no way rips off Mario\\'s music.\\n6) A few fun mini-games that give the game some replay value after you\\'ve finished the main adventure.\\n\\nIf you are craving a super difficult challenge, this game might not be for you... at least not at first. The levels toward the end do get a bit challenging, but not in the same way as the Mario games (which make me want to curse like a sailor and throw stuff at the tv).\\nThe controls were a bit awkward to master at first, but I had no problem adapting after the first few levels.\\n\\nOverall, I really like this game. It\\'s unique and lighthearted fun, and a great way to unwind without having to think too hard.\\n\\nAs far as it being a \"girls\" game... yes, I\\'m a girl and I enjoy it, but two of my guy friends have also played it and really liked it a lot too. We\\'re in our 20s. My 4 year old nephew also played around with it and had a lot of fun, so did his 9 and 10 year old sisters.  Great game for all genders and ages.'\n",

The game features new coments by regis like \"so, you  gonna make it your final answer?\" and this time you actually see him  instead of just his voice. This game has little requirments so it will work  great on anybodys computers. With new questions, new voice-overs and new  suspense, you can\\'t go wrong, especially for just 20$.

Back when I first got my Xbox in december 2001 this game came with the package.

That was just the beginning and there was still more that meets the eye.\\n\\nI noticed that sending bullets into aliens never seemed to get old. How where you place the shot would determine how fast the alien would go down. Headshot by far the most effective while shooting them in the foot proved least effective.\\n\\nThe story itself is fantastically written. Even the events that led to halo (told in \"The Fall Of Reach\") proved to be a well thought out presentation both by the author and the designers.\\n\\nNeedless to say that this is one of the few games (including GTA 3) that changed the gaming world and the normal world forever. I love it.'\n",
      " b\"Before I get started, I want to clarify that I am comparing this to the new Tetris Axis game on the 3DS. While most people tend to stick with the good ol' Game Boy version, I've been finding alternatives. While most renditions of the game, this one actually is one of the few that gets it right. Nintendo did something right when combining Tetris with retro Nintendo action. The graphics are gorgeous and the music is beautiful. I actually went in reverse so to speak as I picked up Tetris Axis. That game was everything I hoped for and more in a Tetris game and more and do does this one.\\n\\n Tetris DS is one of the most addictive games I played and the modes are so much fun! I haven't done the online game play yet, but the modes on here are beast! Even though Tetris Axis has over 20 modes (which are addictive as well), this one has perks of its own to make you want to have both games :) too bad there isn't a rendition of Tetris DS for 3DS in the making lol thats wishful thinking. But if you enjoy Tetris with a mix if Nintendo at it or just looking for a great puzzle game, this, or Tetris Axis, or both, will be your game(s) :)\"\n",

The controller is the source of your gameplaying skills and being chunky, well beng chunky aint good.  Another reason of the teribbelness9is that a word?0 is the shape and placement of the buttons.  i mean comeon oval?  The buttons are also stuck on the tippy top of the controller which(again) means that this will be tough for the little handed ones.

      " b\"(MY REVIEW)Listen, In 2001 I remember buying GTA III and being blown away,and being so addicted to it, that my muscles remember all the codes and i finished the game in 2 days, i spent 40 hours in 2 days, i counted all my hours playing GTA III and it came out to 489, thats about 5 months straight of GTA III, now onto the review...being a GTA addict, I know what makes a game fun and this game is the closest thing to perfection imaginable, indoor spaces, authentic music, and MOTORCYCLES. Also, this time around your guy has a name,(Tommy Vercetti) and is big mouthed and pissed off, your guy in this game swears and talks more than scarface, the sheer beuty of the lush environments made my jaw drop, also I noticed other things like, you can destroy cars with bats and melee weapons, you can get helecopters and tons of new cars/boats, i counted about 200 new cars, 10 boats, and 4 motorcycles. AGAIN, THIS GAME IS A REVAMPED VERSION OF GTA III WITH AN ACTUAL PLOT, A coke deal gone wrong, a pissed off mob boss, and you, (tommy vercetti)has to get the money back of you will be killed. The size of vice city is huge it is atleast twice the5size of small ol' Liberty City. This game is off the hizzle, for only 50 bucks, missions are also a blast, I've already played 20 hours, and the indoor environments kick {butt}. You can also buy new houses if you don't like your current one, and go into shopping malls, You can also buy Stripclubs and bars. The first time you put the disc in you will be addicted. ALSO, the aiming system is changed (Thank god), it is now easier, and more fun. Overall I give this game a 98.5% it is fun and you have to get it....please just buy it......\\nGameplay:99.2%\\nGraphics:93.6%\\nFun:100.0%\\nNew Features:95.8%\\nOverall:98.5%\\nJust get it.\"], shape=(64,), dtype=string)\n",

      " b\"Okay--let's get one thing straight.  On technical merits, there is no argument that any person can make that this isn't the greatest game in the series to the point that it was made.  To put it simply, the graphics are mind-blowing.  I started this game IMMEDIATELY after finishing seven, and from the opening scene, I can assure you that you won't find better in the earlier series.  As always, the sound is solid and the gameplay is well structured, so what you end up with is a game that is, in fact, technically superior to anything Square had done to that point, and is still impressive today.\\nThe concern that most people have with this game, however, has nothing to do with the technical merits, and I'll admit that there's some merit to complaints about the game's story.  While the idea that Square set out with in development is fine, ultimately, the tale fails to break out of the same old pattern that's been carved out for Final Fantasy games from the beginning.  Ostensibly a love story (and I can assure you that it works well in that regard, as the individual character development and storytelling is honest and well paced), the plot seems to vascilate schizophrenically between a poorly described threat to the survival of the world and the plight of the individual characters.  This can get frustrating at times, especially considering the fact that the story could have been told just as effectively if the writers had never worried about introducing the notion of saving the world.  In the end, however, the plot confusion turned out to be a wash for me, since the real story (the love story) is told as adeptly as the genre and cultural incompatibilities will allow.\\nConsidering the price that this game carries right now, the sheer technical impressiveness that it shows, and the great history of the series, it's probably fair to say that any Playstation gamer should add this to their collection.  At twenty dollars, just the CG movies alone are worth the price of admission, and if you're willing to learn a new advancement system (the junction system, while it infringes upon the uniqueness of individual characters, is fun in its own right), you should find that the game itself is entertaining and enjoyable to play.  While there may be some plot mistakes, in total, this game still has to be considered a smashing success, and a welcome addition to any gamer's library.\"\n",

      " b\"This is a game programmmed with great detail. It will bring you back to the castlevania days before the series ruining n64 game. the backgrounds are so vivid, you can easily get the image of being in Dracula's castle. the game is made with so much detail that it rivals some of the n64 games.\\n  It is challenging for most, and with the new dss (dual setup system) it reallly shines. As you destroy enemies, dss cards randomly appear and you can then use them for their powers. the dss system has more than 80 effects that use up mind power, creating a never ending expanse of possibillity.\\n  You storm through Dracula's castle fighting his minions and gaining experiance points to go up levels. You then fight bosses and move around collecting items to improve defense or attack. The graphics and color of this game are just superb, and the wide screen of the game boy advance drastically improves the side scrolling action.\\n  After you beat the game, you can then go through the game again with all dss cards, creating a much different feel, making you want to play the game all over again. It is definitly worth buying as a first game, atop priority over super mario advance and maybe een tony hawk pro skater 2. If you pick up this game, you will right away see the amount of detail put into the making of this great program.\"\n",
      " b'So long as you don\\'t include originality as part of your game evaluation process, Saint\\'s Row is a stellar, stellar piece of programming.  It fixes five of the six problems with the GTA series, and offers tons of little \"next-gen\" improvements that make it more palatable for older gamers.\\n\\n1)Graphics: The draw distances and general graphical ... \"cruddiness\"... of the PS2 (and even the XBOX) versions of GTA are a thing of the past.  The game looks great.  There\\'s some pop-up with long streets, but the explosions, character models, and polish is simply a vast improvement.  I actually thought San Andreas looked worse than Vice City, so this is almost a two-step improvement for me.  The explosions, weather and lighting effects, and reflections are really incredible when you consider the lack of loading times.\\n\\n2)Auto-Aiming:  It\\'s gone.  I\\'m not quite used to the borrowed FPS style yet, but anything would be better than the broken auto aiming feature of GTA.  It shan\\'t be missed.\\n\\n3)Save Scheme:  No longer am I limited to the GTA \"one save per half an hour of playing\" madness.  Hallelujah.  I can\\'t devote large chunks of time to a game, and if I can\\'t save frequently, I lose interest fast.\\n\\n4)Restarting Missions.  Recovering your weapons and restarting missions from the beginning (actually, before the beginning) was asinine in GTA.  It wastes time and annoys gamers without really upping the difficulty.  Also won\\'t be missed.\\n\\n5)On-line.  Haven\\'t had a chance to play with my own copy yet, but watched someone else play.  It might suck, it might be great, but at least it\\'s there.\\n\\n6)Timed, pizza-delivery missions.  They haven\\'t really reared up yet, but hopefully these annoying time-wasters are gone.  We\\'ll see.\\n\\nThe main problems I see with Saint\\'s Row I *suspect* will be solved with Xbox live \"updates\"/purchases.  It took me an hour to realize that there were tons of cars, but no motorcycles, etc.  I have a feeling we\\'ll have to pay for the privilege of flying a chopper or driving a boat.  That will suck.  It better be cheap, because the lack of these vehicle options doesn\\'t feel like a game limitation, but like a conscious programming choice.\\n\\nThe story seems pretty derivative, but I\\'m not far enough along to really evaluate it.\\n\\nI can\\'t really see myself ever playing any current version of GTA ever again.  After only a few hours of Saint\\'s Row you realize that GTA has too many annoying idiosyncracies that should have been fixed long ago.\\n\\nFor fans of the sandbox genre, this is the game to buy, and may be for quite some time.'\n",
      " b\"When I read about what most disappointed people about the sims 3 its that they never had a true open for business style pack for it. Yes they've made some premium content to emulate it but the magic was lost. The frustration of training up your hires, restocking the shelves, and convincing people to buy and not stand around. Sims 3, though I love it on its own merit (I still play both), doesn't match the sims 2 in a lot of ways, this isn't the place for that rant though so I'll leave this here.\"\n",

      " b\"The thing about this game that makes it so good is that the viewers say that it's the best game on the X-box. I have to say that Project Gotham Racing is #1, and Burnout is #2. The game looks so real with the graphics and the it doesn't look fake. But that is how X-box games are supposed to be. Another thing about this game is that when you buy it used, it is $5, which is a reasonable price. One last good thing about the game, is that it can be 4 player multiplayer, unlike Burnout which is only 2 player multiplayer. So, if you want a racing game for X-box, Project Gotham Racing is the one to choose.\"\n",

      " b\"Tomb Raider 2 is my absolute favourite PlayStation game of all-time! I bought the game in December 1997, around the same time I got my PlayStation. But I never really liked Tomb Raider 2 and only managed to get halfway through the first level, before forgetting about it for a while. Four years later, in the summer of 2001, I dug it out again and decided to give it a go with the help of a strategy guide. What a shock I got!\\n\\nAfter the phenomenal, worldwide success of the original Tomb Raider in November 1996, the Eidos Interactive guys put together the sequel, which, in a rare case, surpasses the original with flying colours. To save the game in the first, you had to find a crystal before continuing, wheras in Tomb Raider 2 you have the ability to save the game whenever you feel like. This comes as a great help, especially before taking off into a running jump over deep caverns and steep slopes. Lara also has much greater weaponary comapred to the last game. The first game featured Pistols, Shotgun and Uzis - that was about it. But with this game, you get weapons such as the Grenade Launcher and an M-16 Assault Rifle. While Tomb Raider 1 focused more on enemies in animal form, Tomb Raider 2 has a more worldly feel because the foes are mostly human. But the most notable change on Tomb Raider 2 is the welcome addition of vehicles. Tomb Raider featured none what so ever, but Tomb Raider 2 has a wide variety from the enjoyable speedboat in Venice and the snowmobile in Tibetian Foothills. Lara also took advantage of a make-over. The graphics where background scenery is concerned is still the same as the first game, but Lara herself has changed a lot; her hair is no longer tied in a bun, but flows freely down her back in a pony tail. The reason this wasn't featured in the first game is because the technology wasn't good enough for her hair to be in a pony tail - they couldn't get it to move in motion with her body (rather silly when you think about it now). Lara also possesses the ability to climb certain surfaces. The improved engine also served better lighting facilities, which allowed Ms Croft the ability to wield flares whenever she finds herself in dark areas. When it comes to the levels, the highlights are Venice, Offshore Rig, Tibetian Foothills (short but sweet - involves driving to one end of a road over pits to find a key, before driving all the way back to open a door that allows you to exit and begin the next level), Barkhang Monastery (HINT: Whatever you do, DON'T shoot the monks, they are here to help! They will dispatch any henchmen who try to kill you so you don't have to kill them! Accidently shoot one, and you'll have hundreds of monks trying to kill you!) and Temple of Xian.\\n\\nOVERALL GRADE: 10/10\\n\\nTomb Raider 2 is, in my opinion, the greatest PlayStation game there has ever been. Yes, the graphics are laughable now because they have come so far since - especially on the PlayStation 2 and X-Box, but it all boils down to how enjoyable the game is. And in that category, it is still the most enjoyable and exciting game ever. Hundreds of titles try to replicate the suspense and adventure that is seen in the Tomb Raider games and fail miserably. Buy this now from Amazon - it'd be a shame not to and to ignore it would be missing out on one of the most classic video games of all time...\"\n",

      " b'STORY LINE\\nThis is unfortunate. Because Ive played \"Armored Core\" since its birth, \"Steel Battalion: Line of Contact\" until the servers went dark for its campaign mode, and \"Chrome Hounds\" until it died. So with over a decade of mech gaming experience it\\'s not hard to determine THIS games worth. Which appears to be accurately priced around 8-9 dollars. The story line in single player is the ever so redudndant \"Chase bad guy\", \"Bad guy runs\", \"Catch up to bad guy\", \"Bad guy runs\". Problem with the story which youll encounter time and time again is the main character (\"you\") is voice acted as a \"whiney\" and \"immature\" emo dude. They portray you as this \"I don\\'t care I\\'m going to attack all the time despite the fact Im piloting the junk of the universe\". Theres even a few 3rd person missions where on foot you have some shoddy gunfights. Which suck btw.\\n\\nCUSTOMIZATION\\nThe customization for the Mechs in this game are basic. What was EXTREMELY disappointing beyond anything was the fact that when given the chance to upgrade to better parts they looked exactly identical to the parts you were using beforehand. Basically they designed a pair of arms for you to equip, and gave them 5 different names with 5 different sets of stats. They all look identical though. All heavy arms look like the last, all medium weight arms look like the others, and the smaller arms are the same thing. And this applies to the legs, torsos, weapons, and everything else.\\n\\nGAMEPLAY\\nIts not that bad in the single player. It offers Game-Engine generated movies (of where you are constantly whining), and the single player battles appear on par with barely any lag ever at all. I had the game installed on my console when playing this. The reasons for that will be mentioned below. The battles are smooth and satisfying, however they always felt limited due to the fact that you were forced to engage your nemesis time after time, and each time if you didn\\'t have the most recent mech upgrades (which all look the same as aforementioned) you got your butt kicked. So either equip the ugly arms that weigh too much and complete the mission OR use the arms or parts that were good enough for the last mission and die repetitiously.... all while whining.\\n\\nMULTIPLAYER\\nAh yes. Good ol fashion Mech-on-Mech battles. Ive got the equivalent of a T1 connection. And no the HUB is not far. It didn\\'t mean anything, cause if someone in the server battling it out with you has his grandmother skyping with yer mom about how you need a job and is bogging down the internet connection, the entire game and everyone in it is going to feel the wrath of grandma. The game simply has lag, I installed the game after suffering this over and over again and to my dismay having it installed made barely any difference. Not too mention there does not appear to be any kind of level matching system, as time after time myself and other players were subjected to death after death at the hands of people who had all the good things available for themselves and we had just started playing on day 1. So forget common sense multiplayer matches. Did I mention Grandma and lag?\\n\\nBOTTOM LINE\\nIf you enjoy mech games and like simple non-intuitive mech customization with simple storyline and simple objective based gameplay that removes story advancement and forces you to use things you don\\'t want nor need... its a good game.\\nIf you\\'re looking for groundbreaking mech combat and cool mech customization with the ability to kick ass without being forced to use things you don\\'t want this game is a big NO.'\n",

Being so far into the game I don't want to start over as a male, but I hate that I am missing out on these other features just because my character is a girl.\\n\\nI can only give the game 2 stars for their decision to limit the female characters in an unnecessary way.

      " b'To sum the whole thing up - if you had only one game you could buy for your PSP, let it be this. Even if you don\\'t like first person shooters, get it.\\n\\nSyphon Filter is the best first person shooter - action game out there for PSP, hands down. You get a single player mode \"story mode\" which runs like a charm. The graphics are astounding, taking the PSP to another level. The controls feel right - finally, developers have thought to take full use of all the pads and buttons in a reasonable way.\\n\\nYou play as a super-secret, ex-delta force type, undercover agent. Your mission is to find and destroy Project Dark Mirror. You get a wide range of weapons, but if you are good, you can use a special mode (using a range of goggles) to find secret passages and ways of finishing a level. This means that you can sneak your way without causing much trouble. One of the wonderful things about this game is stealth and the ability to `snap-on\\' to walls and boxes. You can peek over the side and take out enemies without stirring a mouse. Alternatively you can jump out and take on dozens of enemies.\\n\\nThis leads to the only two points of the game that are a letdown. The AI is predictable, and sometime stupid. It\\'s not uncommon to see enemies fall victim to their own mines or walk into your path as you destroy them with your EDT gun. Or you can use hand to hand combat, a knife, special darts, or normal guns. Using these things earns points for earning rewards and unlocking bonus levels. The other thing is - why isn\\'t the game play longer? Seven acts with around five scenes per act make for too short a game.\\n\\nThere is a multiplayer mode as well, for people who like that. (Ad-Hoc + Infrastructure)\\n\\nGRAPHICS: 9/10 (Best graphics and cut-scenes of all time)\\n\\nSOUND: 7/10 (The sound is really great - not complaining, since you can\\'t have it all)\\n\\nCONTROLS: 10/10 (Flawless - you can crouch, look over corners, activate a scope, zoom, and snipe, all at once, without getting frustrated)\\n\\nDIFFICULTY: 5/10 (Moderately difficult - some guys are mounted on turrets!  Difficulty falls tremendously since you can sneak around, using stealth to eliminate much of the opposition)\\n\\nLOAD TIMES: LOW (The load times are not bad at all - plus, you get briefed during the loading screen)\\n\\nOVERALL: 9/10 (Isn\\'t a 10 where you see god or something? Just kidding - the game could easily be a ten if it was 50% longer)'\n",

I expected a huge learning curve and I'm fine with that as I haven't played this series in probably over a decade and the difficulty level adjusting to your skill level seemed to be comparable and fair.

      " b'Crono Cross is the long awaited sequel to one of the best RPGs on the SNES, Crono Trigger.  Even though Crono Cross has few connections with Crono Trigger other than a couple of remixed music tracks here and there, it is still well worth any RPG fan\\'s time.  The battle system in Crono Cross is the most obvious change from traditional RPGs, and can be confusing at first.  Instead of Magic Points, the ability to cast spells and using items in battle are reliant on elemental levels.  Each time you attack, your elemental level increases allowing you to use more powerful spells according to how you \"allocated\" them on that character.  It\\'s not as confusing as it sounds though, so anyone who has played a lot of RPGs before will be a able to quickly adjust within a few hours of gameplay.  That said, Crono Cross is probably best reserved for those who are seasoned RPG players. Other features such as the graphics, sound, and story are all top notch, so there\\'s nothing to worry about in those departments. Branching paths and well over 40 different characters add even more reason not to pass this one up. If you want a break from the same old style of RPG, or are just looking for a title to hold you over until Dragon Warrior 7 or Final Fantasy 10, I strongly recommend Crono Cross.'\n",
      " b\"Even though most other reviews have already said it, it bears repeating: this game is great online!  The game types are: dogfight, team dogfight, capture the flag, keep away (a sort of tag-like game), team keep away, and wild chicken (a game similar to capture the flag, but with only one flag).\\nThe downside to live is that you're dependent on the number of other people online.  You can always find a dogfight game going on, but it's harder to find a keep away or wild chicken game going on at 7 on Sunday morning.\\nThe single player mode is good, but repetitive.  There's only so much flying and shooting you can do before you get tired of seemingly doing the same thing over and over again.  You can get into AA guns and fire from the ground or from vehicles, but overall this doesn't add too much in the way of variety.  The storyline is pretty ridiculous (not in the good way like odd world), and it lacks any sort of complexity.\\nOverall, I really wouldn't recommend buying this game unless you have x-box live.  It's got the great microsoft-title graphics (ala brute force or halo), so it's definately worth renting for that by itself.  But if you don't have the challenge of playing other people online, this game's playability is pretty thin.\"\n",
      " b'First off, I really hate controllers for the computer, but this one is great. Comes in a Playstation like button layout, four normal buttons and four buttons on top. Start and select buttons are also available. So what makes this controller so good? For starters, plug and play, which means you plug it into the proper port of your computer and its automatically detected by Windows! Second, it has a really great comforting grip so that when you are playing for hours on end, it will not wear out your hands. Then also it has an analog for a thumb pad. It might not look like an analog, but there is a ball underneath of the thumb pad that allows for easy 360 degrees of motion (very good for Mortal Kombat type games). There is also a \"precision\" button for great accuracy, for those of you who like intense shooting games. Its fabulous for Windows based emulators. There is one big drawback though, it only works for Windows games, and it is very difficult to use for fast passed games like Tony Hawk.'\n",

      " b\"Fire Emblem Path of Radiance was my first Fire Emblem game. I remember how difficult it was to actually get this game compared to the other ones simply because the game is either a.) overpriced b.) bought used but not working. So now that I finally got a game that worked, I can say that Tellius series is still my favorite of the franchise. Overall I think Path of Radiance is better than Radiant Dawn and here's why.\\n\\nWhile the plot is generic and all Fire Emblem games need a war to start, Ike is the first character to not be royalty an it's his job to protect the princess of Crimea. The game obviously is sending the message that racism and war is bad but...yeah.\\n\\nI love how the Greil Mercenaries are in the game. They seem closer than any of the characters that are royalty if you know what I mean. They all have their problems and struggle to work together. I think the downside of the game is that as other characters are introduced, the Greil Mercenaries fall into the background and only if you actually bring everyone who is a Greil Mercenary in battle do you get different scenes. The whole Serenes Forest chapter is a prime example of showing how close the Greil Mercenaries are. Most people don't bring Mist in that chapter but if you do before a certain scene, she and Boyd actually get into a fight followed by a rather comical scene. Of course, the end of the game shows they're still together even then.\\n\\nI felt like the support system was weak in the game. It's nice to have it but it feels like if you weren't a major character, you didn't get that many support systems period and you have to interpret a character's personality and backstory from the little interactions they had. I personally thought Shinon could have been expanded on more and its mainly based on interpretation on what happened in the time period or why he's such a jerk.\\n\\nAlas, the graphics are a huge step in the right direction from the GBA games. The cutscenes are a first but I felt like the voice acting could have been better or even longer.\\n\\nThis game is needed to get a special scene in Radiant Dawn, but given how fun this game is, who are you to not get this great game in the franchise? XD\\n\\nOverall, this game is what got me into Fire Emblem and made me appreciate Ike being in Smash Brothers Brawl.\"\n",

      " b\"Ryu Hayabusa, Joe Musashi's (shinobi) rival ninja competitor in gaming history. Yet Ninja gaiden had a totally different playing style then shinobi, it still owns up to one of the greatest, hardest games ever. I got this for christmas cuz my genesis broke (time to say good bye to shinobi) so i thought  id lash a buck or two for this game to see what it was like. This game requires THREE important keyes, timing, memorization, and most of all, patience. If you are not good at any of these, turn back now, if so, read on... but don't say i didn't warn you, ninja...\\n\\nStory 4/5- Your father was killed in a duel, you are Ryu, You want revenge. Story goes WAY deeper than that but i don't wanna spoil anything...\\n\\nGraphics 6/5- The gameplay graphics itself was bretty ok but its nes sequels (ninja gaiden II and III) put more quality into it. However, unlike most nes games, this game has highly detailed, not too long and boring or too short, cutscenes inbetween levels and keeps you interested.\\n\\nMusic 5/5- People say the intro to Ninja gaiden II is the best ng music eva. When i heard it i thought, ooook. I totally loved all of the music in this game and there were 2 or 3 tunes that really stand out. Awsome job tecmo, not even ninja gaidens sequels had music as good a this. For those who played Contra on the nes, ya its all here.\\n\\nGameplay- You are a swift, agile, steady ninja who must manage thru levels without falling into pits (mostly enemies fault cuz you get knocked back like in castlevania) and stay alive with a boss to fight at the end of the stage, only the later bosses are tricky. You get a magic thing called ninpo. This allows you to get different ninpo such as art of fire wheel to a cool sword flip maneuver in the air. You can only use them so many times due to how much ninpo you have to use (when you use ninpo, your ninpo thingy goes down) so you need to collect ninpo in levels. You basically need to time your attacks with your trusty katana or you may find yourself dead in an instant (those evil birds and bats ahh dang).\\n\\nFinal Comments- I never beat this game cuz i was stuck on last boss and when you die on him, you start like 5 LEVELS BACK! If your looking for an easier old skool ninja gaiden, check out ninja gaiden II: the dark sword of chaos. I heard ninja gaiden III sucks but if you wanna fish for that too be my guest. But if you get frustrated at this and wanna tear this to scrap dust, don't say i didn't warn you, ninja.\"\n",

      " b\"Ok, so I haven't played it for GameCube as of yet, but I do currently own the Dreamcast version, and to be honest, this title was one of the reasons for me buying a Dreamcast.  This game pits you in the seat of a taxi cab and it's then time to earn some crazy money!  Basicly, you ride around at high speeds and pick up others who need a lift to a certain area in San Francisco in the shorest amount of time, get there with blazing speeds and you'll pick up a great tip.  of course, there's always more stuff with the game such as the Crazy Box, which is almost impossible to beat, it's difficulty rises with each completion of a level.

First of all, if you hit a rotting wood crate going 52MHP it will not cause you to go flying 400 yards, it will break. Second of all, you get a pixel off the track and this annoying screen comes up and tells you to get back on the track in 5 seconds. It will distract you, it will tick you off. This game could be great, but it needs work and I hope version 3 corrects these problem. Please, spend you money somewhere else or at least buy this used!'\n",

      " b'<UPDATE> I have come to really enjoy this game. Unfortunately it lags more than any other CoD I have ever played. I know, all CoD lags, has induced lag, etc. Some days I can\\'t play at all. Games will start, but I\\'ll even lag into the game (won\\'t start right away). I stutter run, can\\'t kill people, etc. Today, I emptied a clip into someone standing 8 feet from me and couldn\\'t kill him because of the lag.\\n\\nCompany is too cheap to have dedicated servers. I guess that is inevitable, Think about it. If you only made a billion dollars or more a year on a game, you wouldn\\'t be able to afford to spend less than 1% of those profits to make the game acceptably playable either. </UPDATE>\\n\\nAt first I really hated this game. It felt like \"Halo\", albeit with better controls  (and I don\\'t like Halo MP, at all). After playing a lot this weekend, I have dramatically revised my opinion.\\n\\nThe game is unlike any CoD before it. The movement in the game just changes everything. In the balance, I think I like it or at least appreciate that it is different. One big plus is that there is much fewer cowards camping in corners or people proving their lack-of-skill by sniping (and hiding in far-away corners). Both these craven, non-skilled groups are still present, but in greatly reduced number. <UPDATE> A lot of non-skilled cowards have found places to camp/hide now. It just took them longer to find ways to try and ruin the game for people who just want to have fun </UPDATE>.\\n\\nAlso, they have removed claymore/mines/whatever from the game entirely. Removing this go-to tool of the laughably unskilled player has really improved the fun-factor of the game.\\n\\nHowever, the game is almost too fast now. Just taking the time to reload often gets you killed. There is still a lot of lag. I don\\'t care about my stats but my win/loss record will be heavily skewed by all the games I have quit because of lag. What I would really like CoD to do? Kill the SP component. I know some people care about it, but most don\\'t. Take that money (seriously, Kevin Spacey doesn\\'t come cheap) and set up dedicated servers for this game. How much would it cost, really? A few million dollars? CoD makes billions. Improve this part of the game already.'\n",

      " b\"For all those reviewers who couldn't make this game work with their video cards, don't feel bad about it; just get your refund and thank your lucky stars that you didn't try to play the wretched thing.\\nI'd really like to have a word with the idiot who designed the user interface. There are several ad-hoc standards for interaction and motion, and URU uses none of them. The involuntary switch between first and third-person viewpoints is clunky and confusing. (Try Schizm II for a good example of how to do it, lads).\\nThere is no conventional save and restore mechanism: the game 'remembers' your latest position and restores you to the start of that level when you restart the game. Infuriating.\\nAlthough several of the puzzles involve moving objects, the only way the system allows you to do this is by nudging them with your feet. What was the designer thinking about!\\nNow that I've got further into the game, my initial impression of the graphics has improved: although much of the interiors are that muddy grey/brown typified by games like Morrowind, there are a few nicely-rendered scenes. Backgound music is sparse, and the samples are too short - after the third or fourth iteration, even a pleasant tune becomes irritating.\\nQuite frankly, the game looks like an attempt to capitalize on the Myst branding by a bunch of money-grubbing hacks who wouldn't recognize a playable adventure game if one jumped out from behind a bush and bit their leg off.\\nBiggest disappointment of the 2003 gaming season, I'd say....\"\n",
      " b\"This is hands-down the best real-time strategy game ever and could even rival the brilliant turn-based Jagged Alliance 2 for best strategy game ever.\\n\\nNormally i despise games with no plot.  I consider them shameless money-makers for studios too busy to come up with a plausible story line.  Here, however, I have no complaints.  Not only was I satisfied with the opening movie's lackluster explanation of the 1000 years of total war, i endorsed it.  The combatants are machines, what plausible storyline could encompass a battle on a million worlds between two robot armies.  I'll take two armies completely bent on the other's destruction.\\n\\nThe gameplay takes computer-battle to a new level.  Infantry, tanks, mobile artillery and rocket launchers, battleships and aircraft carrier, spy planes and bombers: there are literally scores of units available at your disposal for the destruction of the enemy.  Looking brilliant, sounding wonderful, fighting ferociously, the game's title of Total Annihilation is well earned.  I have played skirmishes that lasted for over 24 hours (the game thankfully allows you to save your skirmishes, something not done much in strategy games), and my devotion to one side kept me awake for long nights playing the campaigns too.  It seems inconceivable that there could be people who didn't or don't like this game.  The battlefields are also incredibly diverse, from lush forests (that can be set alight!) to metal wastelands to barren lunar landscapes.\\n\\nI can't reccomend any game aside from Half-Life more highly.  10/10\"\n",
      " b'I found this to be not merely an unsatisfying video game, but the worst racing game for the PS3 that I\\'m aware of.\\n\\nI love playing racing games for about an hour or so every day after work to help me unwind.  This game, though, didn\\'t help me unwind:  usually it made me more furious than my job does, which is saying something.\\n\\nI\\'ve played, I think, every single outing in the Need for Speed series, and, while I wouldn\\'t have imagined saying this at the time, those titles taught an important lesson:  regardless of how difficult the race in question is, practice makes perfect!  You can get it if you just keep practicing until you know ever millimeter of that track like the back of your hand.\\n\\nMODNATION RACERS, though, contains no such lesson.  Whether or not you finish first seems ascribable to nothing more than blind luck, not application.\\n\\nThis is because, in this game, the other racers have weapons they can hit you with, weapons (such as rockets and lightning bolts) that bring your car to a stop and allow the other racers to speed past you.  You could be in first position throughout the length of a race but that doesn\\'t mean anything:  at the last moment, a bolt from the blue can bring your kart to a stop and quickly put you in twelfth place.\\n\\nThis can be quite maddening.  It\\'s true you are given a shield that in theory protects you from such attacks, but even if you use all your race points for your shield, you never have enough shield juice to last you through a race and are liable to being hit just before its conclusion.  (Why couldn\\'t you have been given an unlimited shield that merely slowed you down?  That would have made this game vastly more playable.)\\n\\nDisaster isn\\'t guaranteed, though, which is why you can win races now and then.  But this makes for a rather downer experience from a video game:  you get the feeling that if you finish in the top three, it\\'s not becaue of your agility on the track so much as simple chance.  You can finish a race 2nd, yet your next iteration on the same track will have you coming in 11th or 12th.  Or vice-versa.  If winning races is a matter of skill, this shouldn\\'t be happening.\\n\\nAnd the other racers\\' use of weapons doesn\\'t even make sense!  I\\'m in 10th position!  Why is anybody bothering to fire a rocket at me?!\\n\\nI think they should put \"Ages 7 - 10\" for this on the cover.  This is because I think the kookiness and randomness of the races wouldn\\'t anger kids:  they\\'d just take it in stride as some sort of zany adventure.  Adults, though, are quickly gonna sour on the game since winning a race bears no correlation to how carefully you have negotiated the track or how well you know it.  (Thought:  perhaps the game is a metaphor for the medieval notion of the \"wheel of fortune\"?)\\n\\nAlso:  I mistakenly thought this was a racing game where the player could customize all sorts of things related to the race.  No, no.  You can customize virtually nothing, save purely cosmetic elements such as the stickers on your car or what color helmet your guy is wearing.\\n\\nHere\\'s a short list of things you can\\'t customize:\\n\\na.  how many laps each race is\\nb.  the weather\\nc.  the number of racers in each laps\\nd.  whether or not to allow weapons\\ne.  what position in the starting lineup you\\'re given\\nf.  you can\\'t remap the controls!\\n\\nHere\\'s a list of some other things that variously irritated me:\\n\\n1.  \"Casual\" mode is not easy at all.  I would say it\\'s too difficult to be fun, cause after about 15 times around the same track, there be no joy to it, maties.  Be prepared to do some tracks 20-30 times before pure dumb luck lands you in a spot in the top 3 and you are permitted to advance.  Actually, the \"Casual\" mode itself was a patch that came about because of widespread outrage at the difficulty of the game as originally issued:  but United Front Games apparently didn\\'t get the point of those complaints:  \"Casual\" is still punitively difficult.)\\n\\n2.  You must always start last.  Why?  Why couldn\\'t your starting position have been random?  Am I being punished for something?\\n\\n3.  The game \"announcers\" repeatedly insult the player unless he wins the race.  This is one of those ideas that I think sounded a lot funnier on paper than it turned out to be in the actual game.  When you\\'re playing it just gets demeaning and mean-spirited.  If a teacher said such things to a child, it would be actionable.\\n\\n4.  There is no way replay the crucial tutorials given at the beginning of your career.  Or choose \"New Game\" and reset absolutely everything. You basically have to delete the game data from your PS3\\'s hard drive and completely start again!\\n\\n5.  The game cheats.  You can be zooming along a staightaway going full bore and the AI cars can speed right past you as if you\\'re standing still.  How is this possible if all the racers are driving the same car?\\n\\n6.  The load times are pure murder.\\n\\n7.  The tracks have no character.  They aspire to, but in the end the developers included so many random elements in each one that in the end they\\'re indistinguishable.\\n\\n8.  You can\\'t just get on with the racing in this game:  you\\'re basically obliged to do all the stupid tricks (twirling on your jumps, using weapons, etc.) to win.  Not a good feeling if you\\'d just like to race:  it\\'s more of a combat game.\\n\\n9.  Kinda blows how when you discover a shrewd shortcut, the game resets you, claiming \"illegal shortcut.\"  Hey, I found it!  If you didn\\'t want me to find it, why did you make it possible, you morons?\\n\\n10.  You can get a bonus if you thrust at the very moment the announcer says \"Go!\"  But it\\'s rather infuriating what happens if you \"jump the gun\" on this.  Your character refuses to race ahead, instead turning around and making a cryptic hand gesture to you.  Whose side are you on, you little snot?  I can understand not getting the bonus, but why am I being punished?\\n\\n11.  Blows how you have to confirm a race restart.  This slows everything down.  Restart now!\\n\\n12.  The countdown before the start of the races takes too long.  Another thing that\\'s gonna grate on your nerves since you\\'ll be restarting certain tracks dozens and dozens of times.  The first time I could imagine, but why do we have to go through this again and again?\\n\\n13.  The game does feature \"authorized\" shortcuts, but I don\\'t understand them.  If ALL the AI racers are taking them, THEY\\'RE NOT SHORTCUTS!  They\\'re just the route!\\n\\n14.  Really blows how you can\\'t check out of a race and simply drive around exploring the track, or going back to inspect what messed you up.  Instead you immediately get a \"Off Track!\"'\n",

      " b\"Mario Vs Donkey Kong was one of the most fun Game Boy Advance games I've ever played, mainly because it retained the action/puzzle platforming from the Game Boy's Donkey Kong (Which is one of the best games on that system). The graphics and levels were equally well-polished. As for this sequel, though, it drops the enemy-throwing, hopping and bopping, etc, for having to control Mini Marios. Actually, this makes for a very interesting change in gameplay, and it offers some deep elements.\\n\\nSo...yeah. Mario Vs Donkey Kong 2 has you guide the Mini Marios around the level with your stylus, proving to be a good example of what you can do with the touch screen. But as you move them around, there are enemies, springs, and power-ups along the way. It is awesome getting the Fire Flower, since the Mini Mario that collects it automatically shoots fireballs at the enemies ahead...\\n\\nThe level designs are very interesting and clever. Getting past some of them requires you to really concentrate. The worlds the levels are in totally vary from each other, so when going to another world, be sure to expect something new coming up. For example, there will soon be magnetic floors, as well as pipes that will take the Minis to a different area in the level.\\n\\nThe best feature in the game is the Construction Site, which allows you to make your very own witty levels, and even share them with friends that own the game. That alone would make the game worth it.\\n\\nOverall, this is truly a great DS game. It is definitely one to pick up for all puzzle game fans. However, I prefer the original MVSDK.\"\n",

Lets see ... 10 cool weapons, each  with two attack modes to keep it all a tad more interesting than just point  and shoot. You may actually end up developing something resembling a  personal style with these. Especially interesting is the Translocator,  which in addition to being a nice transportation device allows you to beam  yourself right into your opponents carcasseseffectively ripping them  asunder, of course. Clean me up Scotty!\\nIf you aren't all that crazy  about online games, UT does live up to its claim of being a killer  single-player experience: the bots, boring as they look (except for the  very goth Necris, I think), will keep you entertained and on your toes. The  AI is purty adroit: true, bots don't play like human players, but these  digital playpals get close. They use all weapons and gadgets very  efficiently, go everywhere you go (no cozy endless sniping here), and I  SWEAR that during one Capture-the-Flag game I was ambushed by one waiting  right outside my home base as I rushed after the enemy flag bearer, who had  cleverly activated his personal shield specifically for this maneuver.  Doh!\\nIf you do get bored, you can still tweak just about every aspect  of the game from individual bot intelligence, behavior and weapons  preferences to special mutators for the matches (Want sniper rifles only?  No problem). UT boasts 50 maps, a lot of which are simply breathtakingIll  never forget the first time I was standing on the dizzying height of a  space station tower with Jupiter filling the sky and its moons wheeling  around above my head. You may even catch the occasional shooting star (no,  reallyjust before that nasty sniper feels that youve been standing in one  place long enough). Imagine fighting on board a spaceship zipping through  hyperspace ... or a galleon on moonlit seas ... or in an Egyptian tomb ....  whoa dude!\\nUT adds two new game concepts to the traditional menu: in  Domination you and your team (the bots, by the way, are very responsive  during team play, too) need to hold a number of designated control points  as long as possible in order to win, and in Assault you actually have a  number ofnaturally destructivemission objectives to fulfil  (e.g. storm  the facility, take out gizmo A to get to gizmo B and blow that up too),  after which the tables turn and your team takes the defending side.\\nOh,  and one thing (and my only Quake III - UT comparison): the bots in UT talk  their acknowledgements, comments, and taunts, and they're pretty  nastyquite unlike the witty and urbane remarks of the Quake bots you see  printed on the screen. You might get provoked into anger and violence,  burning to shove their smart  quips back down their throats. You don't mind  that, do you?\\nBut you may want to put on the headphones while your kids  are around ... or your parents.\"\n",

Are they naive and dumb?\\n\\nI am finding it hard to buy Madden each year, each year they get worse, but this one takes the cake. The overall effectiveness of the game is repeatedly declining each year, making less and less playable. The gameplay is worse, defensively it is so difficult to tackle and defend that it makes the game bothersome. Each year, I'm always in the Top 5 in Defense, as I am a defensive type of player in the game. Through 5 games with Arizona, I had given up a total of 155 points!!!

      "       b\"The Rock Band wireless guitar has the look of a real Fender Strat and is noticeably bigger than any Guitar Hero controller.  It definitely feels less like a toy than its competition.  However, performance is ultimately what matters and in this realm, it falls short.\\n\\nBoth the strum bar and the fret buttons feel radically different from the GH controller.  After using both for a while, the GH controller lends itself to better accuracy and higher scores.  The strum bar on the RB guitar is free-floating, i.e. there is no clicking into place with each strum.  I find that the clicking provides your strum hand with necessary feedback on when a note has been registered.  You'll miss a few here and there on the RB guitar as a result.  But the real crime is the fret buttons.  They're nicely-sized, covering the entire fret, so I expected the RB guitar to shine here.  However, they actually do click (and click hard) into and out of place with each press.  Plus, the plastic is strangely sticky compared to the much slicker buttons on the GH controller.  All of this combines into more difficult gameplay, which makes the RB controller less useful and fun to play.\\n\\nThe RB guitar adds some bells-and-whistles functionality like an effects switch and high fret buttons, but they're just unnecessary gimmicks.  Each of the effects just make your playing sound bizarre because their depth is way too deep.  The high fret buttons can be used to solo with one hand (i.e. no strumming necessary), but it's more of a hassle than it initially sounds.  The buttons are awkward to reach, it's difficult to move from the lower to the higher button sets on faster songs that transition quickly to/from the solos, and ultimately, it diminishes the feel and fun of actually playing guitar.\\n\\nMuch like the drum kit for Rock Band, this peripheral needed a little more time on the design table.  Rock Band may be the superior game, but the instrument controllers just aren't up to par.\\n\\nPROS\\n\\n*  Unibody construction has a good, solid feel compared to the detachable neck of the GH guitar\\n*  Large, full-fret buttons\\n\\nCONS\\n\\n*  Sticky/clicky buttons coupled with floating strumbar greatly diminish gameplay performance\\n*  Control configuration is tough for lefties to use\\n*  Incompatible with Guitar Hero games\",\n",
      "       b'I truly enjoyed this game, and almost feel jipped since it took so long for them to port this game to a system I have from the dreamcast.\\nThe storyline is perfect, classic resident evil.  The age old tale of good versus the evil (and slightly demented).  Each character you meet has his own story, but it\\'s not randomly thrown in there.  I can\\'t even explain it on paper without ruining the experience for you, so I\\'ll just say that the story is marvelous.\\nThe game play is even better than previous RE\\'s, with weapons from the old series and a few surprises.  I love the fact that there are weaons that come in pairs, so you can aim at two different enemies at once.  The levels are interesting to play, and I never feel \"ahh, I have to go all the way around there again?  I\\'m bored, why is this so long?!\"\\nSpeaking of length, this RE is also the longest I\\'ve played so far.  The game takes is time slowing bringing you into the world of survival horror.\\nThe music is great, again.  There\\'s a recurring theme in the story, and each time it is played it reminds you of previous scenes in the game... like a ritornello in a concerto, bringing you back into familar terrority.  I like what that does with the mood.\\nThe opening move sequence immediatly brings you into the game.  And later scenes have equal quality sequences.  The facial expressions in the CG\\'s have improved immensely, as well as the character\\'s body position as they interact (no more \"I feel like chicken tonight\" elbows while Clare talks to Leon ^_^)\\nThe only real thing I have to complain about is the terrible voice acting, but that goes with the RE territory, so I\\'d almost miss it if it wasn\\'t there (it wouldn\\'t be a B-movie like game otherwise!  It\\'s almost classic now.)',\n",

      "       b'After all the hype people gave this game I was expecting the revolution of MMORPG games from it. I suppose that my expectations could be considered to high. This game is nothing more than an upgraded version of Lineage 2 meets World of warcraft. You have a WoW style quest system in a Lineage 2 style world and lore. Open world PvP which is not optional as well as a very steep grind. If you are the type who enjoys to quest for 10-12 hours to gain a single level then maybe you will be able to reach the level cap in this game. From my personal experience Aion has a much steeper grind than WoW so if you are looking for something more casual, or an upgrade to WoW I would say try other games first. This can be a fun game but only if you are willing to put in the huge massive amounts of time it will take you to level up your character.\\n\\nAlong with the terrible grind you also have a broken security system. In the 2 months that I played this game 3 people in my Legion were hacked and their accounts suspended. They did absolutely nothing wrong in fact I knew one person from another game who came with me to try this one. Ncsoft does a terrible job at keeping the game secure and your account can be compromised at any time. If you really want to try this game I would say wait until at least the end of 2010 if the game is still alive by then it should be more polished, refined, and the security issues should be a thing of the past.',\n",
      "       b\"I've had my eye on ESIII: Morrowind for some time since the XBOX initially launched.  I held off on buying it when it was released due to the lack of time necessary to invest in this mega huge game.  Now that it's been re-released as a Platinum Hit it made no sense to hold off buying it.\\nThe game is absolutely HUGE.  This is the kind of adventure/RPG game we old school gamers wished for back in the Atari/NES days.  The level of detail is staggering.  There are so many caves/shrines/special locations, all rendered with the utmost detail, one can only wonder how long it took the developers to put this game together!  Some locations are never even used in the main quest!  The bulk of the enjoyment comes from the various side quests and faction quests you can take part in that hvae nothing to do with the Main Quest.  You can join a guild, carry out tasks, or just roam around the varied countryside.  The open endedness is refreshing--for once you can do whatever you want whenever you want!  Should you scope out the hidden mine or help out a townsperson find their stolen jewels?  The choices are yours and the choices are often numerous!\\nI absolutely love this game!  The variety in the graphics, landscapes are breathtaking.  Developing your character is such a joy in this game as the experience system is vastly different from other RPG's!  The weapons and magic system is deep.  And you can even enchant your items!  This game has it all.  It's like an alternate life that you can live and no other game has potrayed it this well.  And those stability issues that others complain about?  Don't beleive them.  I have yet to encounter a crash or glitch in the 30 hours I've invested in the game so far.\",\n",
      "       b\"The real reason to own a PS3 is this game right here. Konami has done it again with MGS4 being the GOTY contender in my book plus the greatest game of all time. I had doubts about MGS4 mainly because Snake has age alot since MGS2 and time has passed by since the events of MGS2. Old characters return from MGS1,MGS2, and MGS3 bringing the events of what happened in the previous games together in this awesome game. You also get new characters who are introduced in MGS4 that feel as they should of been in the previous games included. The graphics push the PS3 to the max almost and the voice acting is amazing plus the controls have gotten a makeover from the previous games. The online mode is better than MGS3 and old maps and new ones return. You should really check out MGS4 if you are new to the series or a fan of the series because you won't be disappointed.\",\n",
      "       b'I can\\'t remember if Myst was my first PC game.  I know it was the one that got me hooked--to the point where I kept upgrading computers and peripherals just to keep up with the games.  I tried to replay Myst a year ago and found I couldn\\'t figure it out (have I lost that many brain cells over the years?), didn\\'t have the patience or something to keep at it.  But like a first love, I remember it very fondly and treasure it.  It\\'s almost heart breaking to think that some day soon, as Windows continues to do upgrade to different styles of OS, newbies won\\'t be able to experience Myst.  Just like so many young people will never know how it felt when rock\\'n\\'roll burst forth.  To confess, I liked the graphics in Riven better.  And I never liked Artus (whatever) or his two sons--thought they were all slackers and whiners with serious emotional problems.  I loved that you could not die and nothing attacked you--really allowed [me] to explore and indulge my curiosity.  Loved the details (little bugs that moved, atmosphere, just everything).  Sound effects and \"music\"--wasn\\'t Myst one of the first to put visuals and music together?  All in all, many good things started with Myst.  I know it was the first computer game that spent time and money on the graphics (something I always appreciated).  At most places, the game play wasn\\'t strictly linear so you could play in whatever order you wanted.  You could \"spin\" around and see everything.  It was totally mouse driven.  One feature I loved (but many others complained about) was that it was an empty world, you never had to/got to interact with anyone else in Myst; for me it was somewhere of my own where I could explore to my heart\\'s content, go back and walk around areas that I liked (like \"tree\" world (can\\'t remember it\\'s actual name) even after you finished that level.  It is an all \\'round beautiful game.',\n",

I would go to a mission booth, run to mission cave, finish it, go to shop, wash, rinse and repeat.  It can take a couple of hours early on to level up, and as it goes on it can take several hours at a time.  I felt like I was getting nowhere and the missions were incredibly repetitive and dull.  All of them looked the same and behaved the same, and you always fought the same handful of creatures or people.\\nTo add to the frustration Funcom constantly tinkered with the game\\'s balance, almost literally ruining the game with one patch, it created so many new bugs and problems people jumped ship big time.\\nI joined a guild which was nothing more than a private shopping chat channel and team matchmaker.  PVP action is filled with no-lifers who \"tweak\" their characters with the help of higher level players and \"implants,\" and Funcom has let this go on since the beginning.\\nThe game is repetitive, frustrating, buggy still, and has the worst lag of any online game I\\'ve ever played, that alone was enough to make me quit.

You also have a variety of weapons to choose from, including; M16, Sniper Rifle, MP50, Desert Eagle, etc. and a mix of flash and frag grenades. The control system is also done very well, putting the most used bottons within comfortable reach of your finers.

It is very challenging. I recommend an ActionReply cheats disc though. It's great having unlimited lives.\\n\\nThere are many treasure chests throughout the levels.

The cars or pods or ships or whatever you wanna call the things you race are amazing.  It takes different skills to race each 1 so being good with 1 doesn't mean your a master of the game.

I used to play with Cammy a lot in old SF games, now I don't even use her because I don't like what they've done with her moves. Feels like they've made her bad. And I'm not even going to start on how bad Juri is.\\n2. Characters look awful. All of them look warped somehow, especially Ken whom they've had to remake a model for because of how bad he looked. Only Ryu and Chun-li look acceptable.\\n3. Work for colors now. Old games would either come with all the colors OR you'd have to play the game a lot and unlock colors for your costumes. Now you either have to buy it(nope) or attempt to get them in small amounts through survival.\\n4. No more arcade. I mean come on. When we weren't playing online or locally with others, chances are we were doing trials, training or doing arcade. Now that's been replaced with a boring story and they've only added trials far after release date so I'm not even counting that.\\n5. DLC. I mean I already don't like the game so paying for characters who should have been in the game from the start does not sit well with me. Yeah you have fight money but geezus you gotta grind all their crappy modes so hard just to try to scrap up enough for 2 characters and then you've pretty much screwed yourself out of buying a costume or something.\\n\\nMy love for SF hasn't made me lose hope yet, I'm really hoping for a Super SF V where they'll add new characters and make drastic changes to some of this stuff.\",\n",

      "       b'The Chronicles of Riddick- Escape From Butcher Bay(2004). Released on the XBox and PC(Since I couldn\\'t find the XBOX one I\\'m doing the PC review).\\n\\n In the past few years, the movie \\'Pitch Black\\' has been hailed as a masterpiece from Sci-Fi fans everywhere, so it\\'s no surprised that a sequel was made, starring, once again, Vin Diesel, entitled \\'The Chronicles of Riddick\\'. In sort of a movie marketing scheme, Starbreeze decided to release a video game that would be a prequel to \\'Pitch Black\\', entitled \\'Escape From Butcher Bay\\', which chronicles(pun alert) Riddick\\'s tenure at the Butcher Bay prison facility, and how he eventually escaped. Deciding to release it as a First Person Shooter, like the game \\'Halo\\', I was enclined to pick \\'Escape From Butcher Bay\\' after reading good reviews, and also that my favorite genre is First Person Shooters. So, did \\'Escape From Butcher Bay\\' live up to my expectations, or fail miserably? Read on to find out....\\n\\n Game Ratings-\\n\\n Graphics- Could they be any better? The dark, gritty atmosphere dominated by bump-mapping and beautiful character designs make this one big piece of eye candy. 5/5\\n\\n Play Control- The control is top-notch, as moving Riddick around, not to mention shooting, is a breeze, and I never found myself frustrated over the controls, except for the last segment where you piloted a Heavy Guard, but I didn\\'t care because it was so fun! 4.5/5\\n\\n Challenge- \\'Escape From Butcher Bay\\' is definitely a challenge, at some points making you face multiple guards with only your fists, but at other times you can find yourself breezing through the game. There are very intricate puzzles, and that\\'s what makes \\'Escape From Butcher Bay\\' tough. 5/5\\n\\n Storyline- \\'Escape From Butcher Bay\\' is fun go through, because of the cut-scenes! I love the plot, and its gritty realism coupled with harsh realities make it plausible, even if it\\'s not. Superb! 5/5\\n\\n Replay Value- Although playing through the game over and over would get old, you are enticed to go back through the game and collect \"Pack of Smokes\" cartridges which enable you to unlock special features. Not the greatest Replay Value, but not bad...3/5\\n\\n Sound/Music- \\'Escape From Butcher Bay\\' has great sound affects, and when the bullets are flying, you KNOW! Plus not to mention great voice-acting, and they got Diesel to even voice himself. Unless you care, there really isn\\'t any music, but it in no way takes away from the game! 5/5\\n\\n Fun- \\'Escape From Butcher Bay\\'\\'s undoubtable strong point is in its fun factor, and I found myself blasting through robots, guards, zombies, and mutated creatures to finish this game in 2 Days! You have an insanely fun time blasting your way through \\'Escape From Butcher Bay\\'!\\n\\n Overall, \\'The Chronicles of Riddick- Escape From Butcher Bay\\' sports excellence in every field, and this First Person Shooter is a masterpiece, and, while not being as good as \\'Halo\\', still gives the player an unmistakeable feeling of having fun as you blast your way through the game. This game gets very tough at times, and I suggest you pick up an Official Strategy Guide to solve the puzzles and get all the Packs of Smokes.\\n\\n HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF VIDEO GAMES EVERYWHERE! PARENTS BE WARNED, \\'ESCAPE FROM BUTCHER BAY\\' HAS GRITTY AND GORY VIOLENCE AND STRONG LANGUAGE, SO I DON\\'T RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE UNDER 18. HAVE A BLAST!\\n\\n Also Recommended-\\n\\n Halo-Xbox and PC\\n\\n Splinter Cell- Xbox and PC\\n\\n Rainbow Six 3- Xbox\\n\\n Thanks For Reading!',\n",

      "       b\"I am an avid video gamer, I've been playing video games since the early 80's.  My love of RPGs came when the first Final Fantasy was released on the orignal nintendo system.  Since then, I have been hooked to the series, buying consoles for the games (PSone/FF7, PS2/FF10, PS3/FF13), not the other way around. After saying that, my all time favorite would have to be FF8.  The graphics are horrible in comparision to todays games, but the game play makes up for it.  Most RPGs have at least 20-40hrs of playing time, but with the FF series, I'm surprised if I spend less than 200+ hrs.  I have played through the entire game over three times over my lifetime, and for me, the most enjoyable part about this game would have to be the side quests and the addictive card game!  I am the type of person that has to have 100% completion before I move on to the next game, and was devastated when my six year old broke disk 4 of this game, hence the reason why I bought yet another copy.  I was tickled pink to find this game had become a classic, with a classic price!  Would've paid more money for the game but was ecstatic to only pay $14 for it!!\",\n",
      "       b'I bought this to play StepMania on my MacBook Pro. It didn\\'t work. It will not register a step if you are standing on another arrow, nor will it register a jump-step. It does not register the \"dance pad code\" - start, select, up for three seconds. Do not buy.',\n",
      "       b'I got this game when it first came out, it was quite buggy. Horribly buggy. Every time I played I ran into problems. I can\\'t say you will, they have patched the game a multitude of times now...\\n\\nSo, moving on, the game play is quite bland. You smash the attack button to crush your opponents, there\\'s no strategy involved. You just keep on hitting that button before your health runs out and you\\'re good to go throughout 100% of the game. The boss battle? (Spoilers ahead) There isn\\'t one.\\n\\nThe ending is very anti-climatic. The man who screwed with your life is a frail coward at the end and when you stand 7\\' over his teeny arse, there\\'s not much else to say other than there\\'s no contest. He\\'s been in his castle for the last 10-something years while you\\'ve been muscling up. Body builder vs. old-frail man.\\n\\nThe quests aren\\'t memorable at all. I can hardly remember any of them. They\\'re boring too. Don\\'t expect them to take long either if you play video games regularly. Most of them end badly because of glitches anyhow (as I said before, they probably patched some quests).\\n\\nThe whole marrying thing is quite annoying when you have two wives, they come over and argue with each other. Not to mention all my kids turned out to be... wait for it... black. Pitch black kids. I\\'m not talking \"African-American\" but the essence of the color black. They weren\\'t mine. One day they\\'re white kids, next day they\\'re black. I never understood why this happened, it just did.\\n\\nIt\\'s not a very good game. Don\\'t expect it to be anything like the first. They sold out big time to reach a larger audience. The gameplay is dumbed down, the story is a sack of bricks, and the co-op is not worth mentioning. It sucks.',\n",
      "       b'Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is the third in a series of three games (to date).  It is available for the XBOX, Play Station 2, PC, Game Cube and Game Boy Advance.  This review is in reference to the XBOX version.\\n\\nThose who are familiar with the Splinter Cell series have come to expect a product that is fresh, innovative and truly ahead of the pack in terms of game play, graphics and all of the more technical aspects of a video game.  Chaos Theory not only lives up to, but exceeds those expectations.  Even though we have now entered the \"Next-Gen\" era, this game still outshines most of the other games currently available.  This is because Splinter Cell games are notoriously ahead of their time and implement the most advanced techniques and technologies available, even if it means creating them from the ground up.\\n\\nIn this third installation of the series the year is 2007. However, I\\'ll skip the obligatory plotline info and get straight to the guts of the game.  The single player mission is of course, utterly superb in every way imaginable.  I could go on telling you about all the intricate story, unbelievably beautiful lighting and particle effects, fluid game play and such, but, perhaps the most important thing is simply that it will literally be months before you stop saying \"these graphics are insane\" or \"OMFG, this game freakin ROCKS\"!  No joke, it\\'s that good.\\n\\nAlso included in the package is the multiplayer mode introduced in Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow.  The graphics have been updated and look great.  A few new gadgets have been introduced: the Mercs now have a camera network at their disposal, while the spies have a heart-beat sensor and the glorious therm-optic camouflage.  A few moves have also made an appearance: the Mercs have charge and berserk abilities while the spies are now able to pull foes over railings and execute an inverted hang.  Pandora Tomorrow would be worth the price just for the MP element.  But that isn\\'t all; once again, the bar has been raised and we are presented with something completely new and unexpected - Splinter Cell Co-Op mode.  In Co-Op you partner up with a friend via Xbox LIVE to take on computer AI throughout a number of well crafted missions for a completely new experience.  Chaos Theory is arguably the best in the series and undoubtedly the most addictive game I have EVER played - I still play it till this day.  Another classic stunner.',\n",
      "       b'If you like the idea of having one ever changing gigantic world with thousands of players online at the same time, then this is a game for you.

This game is  extremely addicting, as you no longer care about anything in real life,  only about getting that next level :)  Has a variety of classes and races  to play from an Ogre Warrior, High Elf Cleric or even a Gnomish  Necromancer.  Great game in all aspects, although very time consuming.  Highly reccomended, A+!',\n",

      "       b\"By now, you have heard the hype surrounding Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion.  I am here to tell you that the hype is real.  The game is fantastic.  The graphics are unreal-they really took them to the next level.  The play mechanics are straight forward for the average PC RPG fan, but there is enough depth to make any hard core gamer happy!  I think the designers hit a perfect balance for any type of fan.\\n\\nAs computer owners, we are constantly reminded that it is expensive to upgrade hardware.  Every once and a while, a game comes out that justifies those expenses.  I think this is the game that should make people upgrade.  And, if you do it now, you won't have to worry about upgrading for the next generation of games.  My computer is plenty powerful enough to run it (Alienware Area-51 5500 with 1Gig Ram, ATI x850 256megs Ram, S-ATA 80 gig HD, Viewsonic VX924 Monitor).\\n\\nHowever, if my computer was too slow, I know I would upgrade in order to play this game, it is that good.  Even after a few hours of playing, I am confident in saying that this game is fantastic!  Any money you spend on your computer will be well worth it!\\n\\nThe beginning level acts as a tutorial. Instead of being ordered how to do things, the game starts open ended (a clue that the entire game will be this open ended as well).  It gives suggestions on things, such as how to use the bow and how to cast spells.  But if you choose to not be an archer or a magician, you can still proceed.  You customize your character at different points based on how you were playing.  I think that is an original design for character creation, as opposed to creating a character from scratch before ever playing the game.\\n\\nI have walked through several large cities, talked to citizens, obtained quests, finished quests, bartered at the shops, changed my equipment, leveled-up some skills, used swords, hammers, bows, magic, etc.-that was all in the first few hours.  I am taking my time walking through the game. Yes, the graphics are that good, and you may want to take the time to admire the world that you are walking through.  Personally, I sometimes rush through games and forget to look around at the world.  This game makes you want to look around, to see what is around the corner, to explore the areas and see what is next.\\n\\nOblivion is going to be huge!  I have read that the main quest is about 25 hours.  If you explore the entire island, and attempt the side quests, the game is hundreds and hundreds of hours.  I still know people playing Morrowind-I expect Oblivion to last as long, if not longer.\\n\\nYes, my computer is setup for games and the gaming experience. So far, Oblivion has proved to be a worthwhile experience.  Even for those computers with lower setting should still enjoy this game-the designers made sure that the game was just more than graphics. How it looks should not stop you from buying this game-it is the game experience you should come for.  The fact that it is possibly the best computer RPG ever should make you want to play it no matter what.\\n\\nThe bottom line is: combat is fun, and I look forward to unlocking skills that let me target with my bow, roll out of the way of combat, and summon creatures to help me fight.  The game play is deep and accessible.  There are more items, weapons, magic combinations, character types, NPCs, quests etc. than you know what to do with!  The graphics are outstanding.  The voice acting is some of the best in any game.  The game wants you, the player, to be involved.  You play however you want and whoever you want to be.\\n\\nAnd truthfully, the game is just fun.  What more can you ask for in a computer game?\\n\\nUPDATE: Someone wrote earlier that you can only play in 1st person. This is not true. Use the mouse wheel to scoll back and you can set the distance you want to view your character in 3rd person. Also, you can hot key 8 items (both on the PC and XBox 360) with keys 1-8.  I wish there were more, but it seems to be a strategy type thing set by the designers.  What is important to you? Well, you get 8 things to hot key.  The key F1-F4 call up your charater page, inventory, spells, and map/journal.  This should make inventory management a snap.  Hopefully, those who are making comments about these things either read their manauls or try things out before making it a negative complaint about the game.\\n\\nI started a new character already and I am enjoying the game so much more with this custome Battle Mage!  This game is great because it encourages experimentation and exploration. Enjoy!\",\n",

Not sure if it\\'s something in the design of the new Wii remotes, which are also branded for Wii U and have the MotionPlus built right in.  But there\\'s definitely something wrong here.  I spent 10 minutes fiddling with the remotes, trying to get them to lay properly in this charger.  But no matter what I tried, I could never get the charging lights to kick in and stay on for more than a couple seconds.  I did remove the silicone cover, and even the wrist straps, from the remotes; all to no avail.  Quirky is one thing; I can live with that.  But this....?

      "       b'Wow!  This game is great!  I could not believe the first time I put this game in my X Box and set it off.  It truly is fantastic.  I first noticed the wonderful soundtrack.  The music continues on, and is not abrupt, when sinister things happen.  It reminds me of the background music you hear during scary movies like \"Psycho\" etc, when  you are watching the protagonist do something he or she is not supposed to be doing.\\n\\nFlying around is quite natural with the X Box controller.  In fact, it reminds me of the ease of most Sim racing games.  There is a bit of a learning curve learning about sighting enemies on the map, and flying around them to attack, but once you get the hang of it, you\\'re in like Flint.\\n\\nRecommended and enjoyed by my whole family, including a 5 year old.

I couldn't wait for the genesis version to come out. When it did I was not disapointed. Sure the graphics and melee attacks aren't completely the same. evertheless this was very close version to the arcade. It plays very similar especially if you have the Genesis arcade sticks!!!

      "       b'I\\'ve always been a big fan of this game once I mastered all the controls. I\\'ve beat it at least 15 times (taking roughly 12 hours to finish each playthough) and still have found memories of this game. I found the more ancient setting of this game a refreshing change from typical star wars games as in this game, the presence of Dark Jedi were common and the galaxy was accustomed to fighting enemies. The worlds in the game are simple, but very fun and there\\'s even some good mods you should get out (pretty sure they\\'re only for the pc though). I also found it interesting how much personality is given to all the characters in here, even minor ones. Humorous situations appeared quite often. And then the big one, you can decide if you wish to play as a good or evil character (personally I love being mean as a bad guy).\\n\\nThere are some weaknesses, the game can feel repetitive after awhile, the last \"level\" of the game is just kill kill kill and it doesn\\'t do the best job of building up suspence. there really isn\\'t much reason to play as any character other than your own so leveling them up doesn\\'t feel that impressive, finally (this isn\\'t a true dislike) the differences between playing as a male or female and light and dark are not very different so playing it one way gives you most of what the game has to offer.\\n\\nStill, great job Bioware.',\n",

I realize that others enjoy this game, but unfortunately I could not get into it.\\n\\nI enjoy the old Dragon Quest games along with the Final Fantasy games.  If you like those, then you might be interested in Dragon Quest Monsters:Joker\\n\\nI'm still looking for a good 'real-time combat' game other than Zelda.

      "       b\"When I first heard of Smackdown 2006 I was skeptical. How many improvements could be made to a game in a year that is usually only released every 2 to 3 years? The answer is A LOT!! The good people at THQ and Yukes must have been working on this game before they released last year's not so special Smackdown vs. Raw. The bottom line is Smackdown '06 delivers the most realistic (or should I say true to life) wrestling experience to date. This game simply blows every other installment of the Smackdown franchise out of the water in ALL departments (graphics, sound, fighting system, season mode, and new features).\\n\\nGraphics - First of all, the graphics look like something that belongs on a next generation system. I don't know how they did it but the wrestlers look so much like their real life counter-parts it is down right spooky. The first time I saw Triple H pause and throw his bottle of water into the crowd I got goosebumps because you'd swear you were watching real footage. Also there is no visual drop-off in the quality of created superstars, which is a first. The crowd models look better than ever and on some entrances you actually can see the other wrestler in the ring waiting for you (depending on if the camera angle is right) making the entrances look like much more then canned animation sequences.\\n\\nSound - Though most people don't by a wrestling game for it's sound the commentary is much better than it has ever been. It's still repetitive at times but even Madden games haven't solved that problem yet. The voice overs for the wrestlers are delivered much better then last years and created wrestlers can be assigned voices as well as a voiced, name and city for their entrance.\\n\\nFighting System - Now down to the brass tacks. It may look and sound good but what about the fightin'?!! Fans of last year's game may be in for a disappointment this year because the overhauled fighting system is much more reminiscent of Smackdown: Here Comes The Pain in terms of pacing. The matches have been slowed down quite a bit to allow for a more tactical approach and to reflect the real pace of a real life match. The computer reverses moves much more than ever which can be frustrating at times but this simply forces players to use a little more variety in their tactics than they are use to. ALSO the biggest change is NO MORE ENERGY BARS. Matches are won by wearing down your opponent by targeting you attacks to a specific area of their body and by swing the momentum of a match (by dominating your opponent by chaining moves together and gaining crown approval). This fighting system, while slower and more deliberate, is true to life wrestling experience.\\n\\nSeason mode - The season mode visuals are much better this year along with the previously mentioned voice-overs. Cut scenes look like something you'd see on a WWE program, with changing camera angles, and compelling acting (wink, wink). There are wrestler specific branches that should keep the repetition to a minimum.\\n\\nNew Features - Finally there are more features than you can shake a barbed wires bat at. New match types including the buried alive format. A GM mode that mirrors the GM modes we've seen in other sports games and a beefed up online mode that supports 4 players and tradeable created wrestlers.\",\n",
